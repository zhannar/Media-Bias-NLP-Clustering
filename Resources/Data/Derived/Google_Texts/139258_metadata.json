(NASDAQ: ODFL) today reported its results for less-than-truckload (\u201cLTL\u201d) tons per day and revenue per hundredweight for July and August 2015. LTL tons per day increased 7.7% and 5.8% in July and August 2015, respectively, compared to July and August 2014. These increases reflected growth in shipments of 12.9% in July 2015 and 11.7% in August 2015 compared to the same months in 2014, partially offset by a year-over-year decline in LTL weight per shipment of 4.6% and 5.3% in July and August 2015, respectively.\n\nOld Dominion also experienced a year-over-year decrease in LTL revenue per hundredweight of 0.8% for July 2015 and 1.2% in August 2015 compared to the same months in 2014, primarily due to declines in fuel surcharges. LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 5.3% and 5.6% in July and August 2015, respectively, compared to July and August 2014.\n\nDavid S. Congdon, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Old Dominion, commented, \u201cWe are pleased to report the strong growth in our LTL shipments for July and August, which were consistent with our long-term growth trends. Our LTL tons per day also continued to grow against difficult year-over-year comparisons of 18.8% and 19.0% growth for July and August 2014, respectively, and the continued decline in our LTL weight per shipment. We believe the pricing environment continues to be stable and are confident in our ability to continue to gain market share while also improving our yield.\u201d\n\nForward-looking statements in this news release are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
