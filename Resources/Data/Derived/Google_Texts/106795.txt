The BBC has come under fire after new figures showed spending on taxis for staff at its Broadcasting House headquarters has soared by nearly 60 per cent.

A Freedom of Information Request has shown it spent £116,000 on fares in 2013-14 - compared with £73,000 in 2012-13.

Critics say employees should turn to public transport more after the cost of transporting staff to and from the building went up by more than £40,000.

The BBC has come under fire after new figures showed its spending on taxis for staff at its Broadcasting House headquarters has soared

The number of staff in the central London building has grown from 1,260 in 2012 to about 4,500 employees in 2013 and the BBC say the spending per head on taxis has more than halved as a result.

But Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'This is an enormous amount of money and the big increase shows that the BBC can tighten its belt.

'Though some of these journeys would have been unavoidable, in many cases public transport must have been an alternative.

'The licence fee is too high and cutting these costs could mean they could reduce the licence fee and give hard-pressed families a break.'

Over the past two financial years, staff made around 47,000 expense claims including for taxi journeys.

It covers the period when the BBC moved employees from their old office, Broadcasting House in west London, to the new headquarters in Oxford Circus.

The figures come just days after it emerged that spending on expenses rose during Lord Hall of Birkenhead's first year as director-general in 2013, despite a cost-cutting drive

The figures come just days after it emerged that spending on expenses rose during Lord Hall of Birkenhead's first year as director-general in 2013, despite a cost-cutting drive.

Senior managers spent around £66,000 wining and dining TV stars and other contacts.

And expenses for the corporation's most senior executives rose by seven per cent in Lord Hall's first year to around £691,000.

The broadcaster says that the cost per head of taxi fares fell to £26 in 2013/14 compared to £58 the previous year and among senior managers, their taxi bill is down seven per cent from last year.

A BBC spokeswoman said: 'As we have closed some of our old buildings, staff numbers have more than trebled in Broadcasting House.
