Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said that the move was simply a political ploy and that any changes to health care plans, such as premium increases, for example, should be public before the election.\n\nBut Carney said the administration expects more people to sign up for health care insurance at the end of the current, initial open enrollment period -- which ends March 31, 2014 -- in part because of the website problems, so starting the next enrollment window later in the year would buy insurers more time to assess the situation.\n\n\"What was already going to be a back-loaded process is going to be more back-loaded, and that's going to leave insurers a lot of data to sort through in a short period of time,\" he said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Where's the anonymous shopping perk?

The new deadline is January 15, 2015, Carney said.\n\nThe two-month window is a lot shorter than the current six-month window for 2014 coverage, he said.\n\nAsked why the administration won't change the more pressing March 31, 2014, deadline, as even some Senate Democrats have asked, Carney said the administration still believes the remaining four months is enough time to get people signed up for insurance.\n\nYoung adults are less likely than their older counterparts to take out a health insurance policy, but even without that issue, enrollment in Obamacare has been minute overall, particularly via the federal sign-up website HealthCare.gov\n\nExact numbers are hard to pin down in the 36 states using the site. But as of November 2, just 26,794 people had enrolled in the HealthCare.gov states.\n\nCNN's current tally for this group stands at less than 45,000 enrollees, but that's based on just a handful of states that have provided updates.\n\nIn the 14 states running their own sign-up methods, the numbers look better but still dismal. At least 133,000 people had enrolled at last count.\n\nMany more have taken advantage of the expansion of Medicaid.\n\nSticker shock\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services hopes that the added time will encourage insurers to get coverage details right and make their plans more affordable, while consumers have more time to flush the devil out of the details.\n\nSome consumers were not only hit with high premiums during the rollout but also with deductibles above flood stage.\n\nPeople picking the bronze plan, which has the lowest premiums, will shell out about $5,000 before insurers foot the bills.\n\nEven then, policyholders will cover plenty out of pocket, like doctor visits, lab tests and medications.\n\n\"All we ever heard about Obamacare is that it would lower our deductibles and premiums,\" said Jennifer Slafter, 40 of Mabel, Minnesota. \"That's just not what's happened.\"\n\nSlafter and her husband, Steve, are scrambling to find affordable care for themselves and their two children. The exchange's BlueCross BlueShield plan was $1,087 a month with a $6,000 deductible, while a Medica plan was $877 a month with a $12,700 deductible.\n\nBoth are steeper than their current plan.\n\nBattle ahead\n\nAs a side effect, the enrollment delay could also give everyone more time to contend with the political battle over Obamacare and whatever changes to the Affordable Care Act that might result.\n\nJUST WATCHED Obamacare's youth problem Replay More Videos ...
