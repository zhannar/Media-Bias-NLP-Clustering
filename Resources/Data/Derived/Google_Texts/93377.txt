Sturgis, SD

If you plan on making your way to Sturgis this summer, you'll have new gas and food options to stop by on the way.

Big D Oil will be opening a Big D convenience store and gas station at 2800 Junction Avenue, Exit 32 in Sturgis.

An Arby's restaurant and drive thru will also be opening in the area. Both businesses are expected to be open by August 2015, just in time for the Motorcycle Rally.
