Huh? Huh?\u201d As though that erased the stupidity of relying on a comedy show for news and insight. It is true that conservatives have tried \u2014 and failed, utterly \u2014 to do what Stewart does. There are funny conservatives and funny liberals, but they tend to be amusing in different ways, which is why liberal efforts to replicate Rush Limbaugh\u2019s success have failed in the same way as conservative efforts to replicate Jon Stewart\u2019s. It takes a left-wing sensibility to have Lenny Bruce\u2019s career; it takes a right-wing sensibility to have Evelyn Waugh\u2019s.\n\nAnd it takes a bottomless well of stupidity to rely on either mode of humor for a meaningful map of the world.\n\nBut ignorance is the default position, which is one of the reasons why conservatives are at a perennial disadvantage when it comes to taking policy ideas to the general public. To understand the conservative view, you have to know a little something about supply and demand, about what prices do in a modern economy, about unintended consequences, etc. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t want to raise the minimum wage you hate poor people and love Wall Street greedheads you racist sexist homophobe!\u201d is, by way of comparison, pretty persuasive among the sort of people inclined to take instruction from Jon Stewart. And that sort of discourse is, unfortunately, not restricted to comedy shows. It is the reason that people like Jamelle Bouie and Amanda Marcotte have prominent media platforms, their respective professional obligations being 1) call something/someone racist and 2) call something/someone sexist, i.e., narrowly focused discrediting campaigns substituted for argument \u2014 Jon Stewart minus the laughs. That Bouie, among others, is so completely blind to that fact is a source of some humor in its own right.\n\nStewart\u2019s retirement announcement coincides with the self-inflicted public humiliation of NBC\u2019s Brian Williams, whose accounts of the dangers he has faced as a newsman are even less grounded in reality than is Stewart\u2019s shtick. Inevitably, there are those who have suggested that Stewart should simply take over for the \u201creal\u201d anchorman \u2014 that the Walter Cronkite of the Millennial generation should have the same sort of job that Cronkite himself once had. I don\u2019t disagree, but that Jon Stewart may accurately be described as the Walter Cronkite of our times is a credit neither to him nor to Cronkite \u2014 and least of all is it a credit to his audience.\n\n\u2014 Kevin D.

Huh? Huh?\u201d As though that erased the stupidity of relying on a comedy show for news and insight. It is true that conservatives have tried \u2014 and failed, utterly \u2014 to do what Stewart does. There are funny conservatives and funny liberals, but they tend to be amusing in different ways, which is why liberal efforts to replicate Rush Limbaugh\u2019s success have failed in the same way as conservative efforts to replicate Jon Stewart\u2019s. It takes a left-wing sensibility to have Lenny Bruce\u2019s career; it takes a right-wing sensibility to have Evelyn Waugh\u2019s.\n\nAnd it takes a bottomless well of stupidity to rely on either mode of humor for a meaningful map of the world.\n\nBut ignorance is the default position, which is one of the reasons why conservatives are at a perennial disadvantage when it comes to taking policy ideas to the general public. To understand the conservative view, you have to know a little something about supply and demand, about what prices do in a modern economy, about unintended consequences, etc. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t want to raise the minimum wage you hate poor people and love Wall Street greedheads you racist sexist homophobe!\u201d is, by way of comparison, pretty persuasive among the sort of people inclined to take instruction from Jon Stewart. And that sort of discourse is, unfortunately, not restricted to comedy shows. It is the reason that people like Jamelle Bouie and Amanda Marcotte have prominent media platforms, their respective professional obligations being 1) call something/someone racist and 2) call something/someone sexist, i.e., narrowly focused discrediting campaigns substituted for argument \u2014 Jon Stewart minus the laughs. That Bouie, among others, is so completely blind to that fact is a source of some humor in its own right.\n\nStewart\u2019s retirement announcement coincides with the self-inflicted public humiliation of NBC\u2019s Brian Williams, whose accounts of the dangers he has faced as a newsman are even less grounded in reality than is Stewart\u2019s shtick. Inevitably, there are those who have suggested that Stewart should simply take over for the \u201creal\u201d anchorman \u2014 that the Walter Cronkite of the Millennial generation should have the same sort of job that Cronkite himself once had. I don\u2019t disagree, but that Jon Stewart may accurately be described as the Walter Cronkite of our times is a credit neither to him nor to Cronkite \u2014 and least of all is it a credit to his audience.\n\n\u2014 Kevin D.
