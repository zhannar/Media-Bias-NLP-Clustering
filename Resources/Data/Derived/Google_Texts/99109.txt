The new winners of the latest Mega Millions Jackpot have nothing on Warren Buffett.

The Oracle of Omaha pulled in $12.7 billion in the first 344 days of 2013, for a total net worth of $59.1 billion. That’s $37 million per day and enough to make him the world’s highest earner in 2013, according to a new report from consulting company Wealth-X.

Even after that haul, however, Buffett is not the wealthiest billionaire on Wealth-X’s list of the top-earning billionaires of 2013. Buffett is second to Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, who added $11.5 billion to his coffers for a new net worth total of $72.6 billion.

The third highest-earning billionaire of 2013 was casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who cleared $11.4 billion, increasing his personal net worth to $35 billion.
