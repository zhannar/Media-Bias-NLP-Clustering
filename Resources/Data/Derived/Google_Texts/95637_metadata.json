In 2008, the organization created the Amethyst Initiative , a group of college and university presidents advocating for a lower drinking age of 18. Public health and traffic safety experts responded with dozens of new research papers on MLDA's effectiveness. The study, \"analyzed dozens of peer-reviewed journal articles that evaluated MLDA 21 in the United States or that investigated the potential effects of raising or lowering the MLDA.The investigation came as a response to advocacy organization Choose Responsibility's call in 2006 to repeal the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984 , which led all 50 states to establish MLDA 21 or risk losing millions of dollars in federal transportation funds\n\nAccording to study authors William DeJong and Jason Blanchette, researchers at the Boston University School of Public Health and School of Medicine, MLDA 21 has \"served the nation well by reducing alcohol-related traffic crashes and alcohol consumption among youths while also protecting drinkers from long-term negative outcomes they might experience in adulthood, including alcohol and other drug dependence, adverse birth outcomes, and suicide and homicide.

Compared to other regions of the world, Europe has the \"highest per capita alcohol use, the highest percentage of deaths attributed to alcohol, the highest burden of disease related to alcohol, and the highest prevalence of alcohol dependence,\" according to the study. According to study authors William DeJong and Jason Blanchette, researchers at the Boston University School of Public Health and School of Medicine, MLDA 21 has \"served the nation well by reducing alcohol-related traffic crashes and alcohol\n\nhas little or no life-saving effect.\" His research, comparing traffic fatality rates in states before and after they changed their MLDA from 18 to 21, examined separately the impact in states that adopted an MLDA 21 on their own and those that were \"coerced\" by the National Minimum Drinking Age Act.\n\n\n\nAccording to Miron, \"virtually all the life-saving impact of the MLDA 21 comes from the few early-adopting states, not from the larger number that resulted from federal pressure. Further, any life-saving effect in those states that first raised the drinking age was only temporary, occurring largely in the first year or two after switching to the MLDA 21. Our results thus challenge both the value of the MLDA 21 and the value of coercive federalism.\"\n\n\n\n45 states currently have MLDA 21 exceptions for some forms of alcohol consumption. 29 states allow exceptions on private, non alcohol-selling premises with parental consent, 6 on private non alcohol-selling premises without parental consent, 26 for religious purposes, 16 for medical purposes, 4 for government work related purposes, 11 for educational purposes, 17 when reporting medical need due to underage drinking for another minor, and 10 on alcohol-selling premises with parental approval.
