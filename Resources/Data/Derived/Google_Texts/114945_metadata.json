With both sides to the marketplace \u2013 device development and big data management \u2013 ripe for applications within the remote patient monitoring and chronic disease management fields, the IoT ecosystem will likely see rapid adoption among value-minded providers.\n\nCost-cutting cloud computing technology to present new options for providers\n\nCloud computing technologies have the potential to support health IT initiatives ranging from medical device management to computerized provider order entry (CPOE), states a separate Research and Markets brief.\n\nSoftware-as-a-service (SaaS) vendors often offer attractive pay-as-you-go pricing structures, while promising minimal downtime and comprehensive management of technology needs.\n\nSeveral cloud EHR vendors, including athenahealth, Practice Fusion, and eClinicalWorks, are among the leaders in the US cloud-based electronic health record market, but SaaS tools could expand to encompass a larger number of provider needs.\n\nRadiology, laboratory, and pharmacy information systems may soon move to the cloud, the report predicts, and non-clinical capabilities like revenue cycle management, payroll and patient billion, claims management, and supply chain analytics are set to follow. Cloud capabilities may also support the Internet of Things activities mentioned in the above segment.\n\nGlobal business intelligence platform market set to grow at a 9.7 percent CAGR\n\nBusiness intelligence analytics tools are becoming critical to healthcare organizations as they seek novel methods to trim costs and gain insights into their performance. The global business intelligence platform marketplace is slated to grow from an estimated 8.9 billion in 2015 to $14.2 billion in 2019, representing an estimated 9.7 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR).\n\nNotable vendors in the marketplace include IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Qlik, SAP, and Tableau Software, the report adds.\n\nGlobal big data analytics market will explode at 23 percent CAGR to 2019\n\nHealthcare providers aren\u2019t the only ones trying to get to grips with their big data. Opportunities for big data analytics investments will increase at a 23 percent compound annual growth rate until just before the end of the decade, says Research and Markets.\n\nA separate report from MarketsandMarkets, published in August, predicted even higher growth for the healthcare segment of the big data marketplace. Provider organizations are likely to drive an $18.7 billion marketplace at a CAGR of 26.5 percent until the end of the decade.\n\nThe report notes that pressures to slash spending, compensate for dwindling meaningful use incentives, and improve the quality of care will continue to push healthcare providers into adopting big data analytics tools.\n\nTop vendors in the market include IBM, Epic, Cerner, McKesson, MedeAnalytics, Inovalon, Allscripts, Oracle, SAP, and Dell.\n\nPayer outsourcing market will continue to heat up through 2020\n\nHealthcare payers have been under a great deal of stress as they attempt to cope with the significant overhauls mandated by the Affordable Care Act. To reduce costs and streamline their administrative efforts, many insurers are turning to outsourcing.\n\nNorth American payers, spurred on by the ACA, are likely to drive the most significant growth in this market segment, says Research and Markets. This prediction is mirrored by a recent poll from Black Book Research that pin the payer health IT outsourcing market at $60 billion by 2017.\n\nNinety-three percent of payers participating in the survey said they are planning to outsource at least one data analytics capability in the next two years, though only five percent of large health plans are considering undertaking an end-to-end outsourcing program.\n\nConcerns over data security and the difficulty of managing multiple external vendors while maintaining a high quality of service are limiting factors in payers\u2019 outsourcing plans.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Healthcare big data analytics, the Internet of Things, payer outsourcing, and the cloud are all likely to experience significant growth over the next few years.", "author": "HealthITAnalytics", "og": {"url": "http://healthitanalytics.com/news/healthcare-big-data-analytics-iot-cloud-markets-set-for-growth", "site_name": "HealthITAnalytics", "image": "http://healthitanalytics.com/images/site/articles/ThinkstockPhotos-476911109-200200.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Healthcare Big Data Analytics, IoT, Cloud Markets Set for Growth"}, "twitter": {"description": "Healthcare big data analytics, the Internet of Things, payer outsourcing, and the cloud are all likely to experience significant growth over the next few years.", "creator": "@HITAnalytics", "image": {"src": "http://healthitanalytics.com/images/site/articles/ThinkstockPhotos-476911109-200200.jpg"}, "title": "Healthcare Big Data Analytics, IoT, Cloud Markets Set for Growth", "site": "@HITAnalytics", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd30e3\"", "article_summary": "Global big data analytics market will explode at 23 percent CAGR to 2019Healthcare providers aren\u2019t the only ones trying to get to grips with their big data.\nOpportunities for big data analytics investments will increase at a 23 percent compound annual growth rate until just before the end of the decade, says Research and Markets.\nA separate report from MarketsandMarkets, published in August, predicted even higher growth for the healthcare segment of the big data marketplace.\nWith both sides to the marketplace \u2013 device development and big data management \u2013 ripe for applications within the remote patient monitoring and chronic disease management fields, the IoT ecosystem will likely see rapid adoption among value-minded providers.\nThe report notes that pressures to slash spending, compensate for dwindling meaningful use incentives, and improve the quality of care will continue to push healthcare providers into adopting big data analytics tools."}
