Espinoza tells Breitbart News Daily host Stephen K. Bannon:

This gun grab is completely unconstitutional and I fear the Congress will do the same thing they’ve done in the past” when Obama has acted unconstitutionally. “They funded Obamacare. They funded executive amnesty…. I fear that if the people do not rise up quickly and strongly, that this Congress will cave once again.

Espinoza said if she is elected to Congress, she would not vote for Paul Ryan, or anyone like him, for leadership. She also criticized GOP Rep. John Culberson, who currently holds the seat.

Citing Culberson’s Committee assignments, Espinoza said, “He has the power of the purse to stop all this and look at what he did. He funded Planned Parenthood, although he sent out an e-alert telling people he would not. He funded Obamacare. He even funded this executive amnesty…. I cannot believe this man is not resigning.”

The website for Espinoza’s grassroots campaign is MariaforAmerca.com.

She blasted Obama’s speech, asking where were his tears as a host of American citizens she named were “slaughtered” by illegal immigrants.
