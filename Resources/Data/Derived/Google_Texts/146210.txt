President Barack Obama next month will award the nation’s highest military honor to a Marine corporal who was severely injured while shielding a fellow Marine from an enemy grenade.

Cpl. William “Kyle” Carpenter, 24, on June 19 will become the eighth living recipient of the Medal of Honor for actions in Iraq or Afghanistan, the White House said Monday.

Cpl. Carpenter served as an Automatic Rifleman in the 1st Marine Division in Helmand Province when he was severely wounded during a Nov. 21, 2010, engagement with the Taliban.

Cpl. Carpenter’s squad was under attack when enemy forces threw three grenades over a compound wall, according to the Marine Corps. The first grenade injured one Afghan National Army soldier, the second failed to detonate and the third landed near Cpl. Carpenter and Lance Corporal Nicholas Eufrazio, who were stationed on a rooftop observation post.

Cpl. Carpenter positioned himself between the grenade and Lance Cpl. Eufrazio, absorbing most of the resulting explosion.

He was severely wounded with a depressed skull fracture, multiple facial fractures, one-third of his lower jaw missing, a collapsed right lung and multiple fragment injuries to both of his upper and lower extremities, the Marines said.

He was medically retired from the Marines due to his wounds last year.

The Flowood, Miss., native is now a full-time student at the University of South Carolina in Columbia.

The medal is awarded to members of the armed forces who distinguish themselves conspicuously by gallantry above and beyond the call of duty.
