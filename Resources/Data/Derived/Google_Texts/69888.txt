The prime minister of Antigua & Barbuda has appointed actor Robert De Niro as special economic envoy of the twin-island nation in the eastern Caribbean.

The administration of Gaston Browne said in a statement Saturday that the appointment comes after De Niro signed a memorandum of agreement on Friday for a $250 million hotel investment in Barbuda.

Officials said De Niro and Australian businessman James Packer will help renovate and expand a former five-star luxury resort that closed several years ago.

Browne said he expects the deal to be signed in late December and for construction to begin in the next 12 months.

He said De Niro will help attract more investment and American celebrities to Antigua & Barbuda as special economic envoy.
