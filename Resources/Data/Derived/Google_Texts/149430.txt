Abortion industry political advocacy group NARAL Pro-Choice America attacked a Doritos Super Bowl ad which features an ultrasound of an unborn baby as “anti-choice.”

#NotBuyingIt – that @Doritos ad using #antichoice tactic of humanizing fetuses & sexist tropes of dads as clueless & moms as uptight. #SB50 SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER — NARAL (@NARAL) February 8, 2016

Taking to Twitter, NARAL charged the humorous ad that showed a spunky unborn baby responding to a Dad eating Doritos used an “antichoice tactic of humanizing fetuses and sexist tropes of dads as clueless and moms as uptight.”

You can see the ad here.

NARAL also weighed in on the Snickers ad seen during Super Bowl 50. It depicted a grumpy man wearing the blowing white dress Marilyn Monroe wore in the midst of her iconic scene from the film The Seven Year Itch. Once the male stand-in eats a Snickers candy car, he turns into the real Marilyn Monroe who then appears in her famous scene.

.@SNICKERS, what was up w that commercial? Transphobic & implies women OK w being objectified as long as they have snacks #NotBuyingIt #SB50 — NARAL (@NARAL) February 7, 2016

The abortion industry advocate tweeted the Marilyn ad was “transphobic” and that it suggests women are agreeable to “being objectified as long as they have snacks.”
