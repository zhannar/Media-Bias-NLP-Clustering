SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — Former NBA guard Rex Chapman has been arrested for allegedly shoplifting $14,000 worth of merchandise from an Apple store in Scottsdale and then selling the items at a pawn shop.

Police took the 46-year-old Chapman into custody Friday afternoon after officers stopped his vehicle in northeast Scottsdale.

They say he’s being held on suspicion of nine counts of organized retail theft and five counts of trafficking in stolen property.

Police say Chapman made it appear he was using the store’s self-checkout, but left without paying.

He allegedly stole from the store seven times and sold the items for cash.

Chapman, a former Kentucky star, was a first-round draft pick of Charlotte in 1988. He also played for Washington, Miami and Phoenix in a 12-year NBA career that ended in 2000. He later served as vice president of player personnel with the Denver Nuggets.
