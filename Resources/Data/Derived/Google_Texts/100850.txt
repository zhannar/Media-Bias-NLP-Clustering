Senate passes bill targeting ObamaCare

The Republican-led Senate on Thursday approved a bill that would dismantle key elements of President Obama's health care law and stop federal funding of Planned Parenthood. GOP leaders were not deterred by a certain veto by Obama. "He can defend a status quo that's failed the middle class by vetoing the bill, or he can work toward a new beginning and better care by signing it," said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Republicans say ObamaCare is driving up health costs. Democrats say it is providing access to health care for millions who used to be uninsured.
