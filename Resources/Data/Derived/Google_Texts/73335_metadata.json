By his side, a harness whip, a gift from a patient, sat beneath the framed diplomas hanging crookedly on the wall.\n\n\u201cHey, Doc,\u201d Mr. Smith said, settling his 270-pound frame into an armchair. He had hurried back from a job building windmills in Alaska just in time to get his next month\u2019s prescription: four 8-milligram tablets a day, the highest dose recommended, that stave off withdrawal, eliminate his cravings for heroin, keep his mood balanced and alleviate his chronic pain.\n\nGrowing up in the hilltop town of Meyersdale \u2014 \u201cPennsylvania\u2019s High Point\u201d \u2014 Mr. Smith had aspired to follow his grandfather into the family business. \u201cAll I wanted to do was towing, in my Pap\u2019s footsteps,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA rare kidney condition, treated with surgery and potent painkillers, knocked him off course. After several years, he told his doctor that he wanted to wean himself off the pills.\n\nVideo\n\nHe said: \u201cThe doctor stopped dead like I had my pants on backward, and said, \u2018You\u2019re admitting you\u2019re addicted?\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, it ain\u2019t no news flash.\u2019 \u201d The doctor ripped up his prescription and threw it in the air.\n\nMr. Smith spent the next week \u201cdope sick,\u201d shivering, sweating and vomiting. A friend proposed a solution: heroin, cheap and easy to find. \u201cThings started going south,\u201d Mr. Smith said. Then his grandfather died, and he learned that the towing business would be sold.\n\n\u201cI went clean off my rocker,\u201d he said. To finance his habit, he burned through $12,000 in savings and finally drove off to sell the contents of his gun safe, including weapons of disputed ownership. A police officer was waiting when he returned to arrest him for theft. Agonizing on that jailhouse floor, he promised himself he would never use again.\n\nA week later, essentially under house arrest in the custody of his father, a corrections officer, he called Dr. Clark\u2019s office, crying.\n\n\u201cHe saved my life,\u201d Mr. Smith said.\n\nThat was two years ago. In his session last spring, Mr. Smith told his unlikely savior: \u201cI\u2019m sort of pissed at you. I hear you\u2019ve been shooting Airsoft without me.\u201d (The game involves fake guns and pellets.)\n\n\u201cYeah, sorry, buddy,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cI know you\u2019d be into that. What we all do in getting better is to switch to different ways of getting our ya-yas out, right?\u201d\n\nThey talked motorcycles. The doctor drives a Harley-Davidson Fat Boy. Mr. Smith fantasizes about \u201cbarreling down the highway on a Big Dog\u201d but is in too much debt to buy one. \u201cYou know how it is,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Clark nodded. \u201cI thought losing my credit was the worst thing in the world, but it was the best thing in the world because now I\u2019m living on a cash basis,\u201d he said. \u201cCredit is a big scam, man. It uses our addictive nature against us: \u2018I want it now. I want it now.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMr. Smith loves it when Dr. Clark talks to him addict to addict. \u201cI\u2019ve heard patients say he ain\u2019t no better than we are or he\u2019s just in it for the money,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think being an addict makes him a better doctor. He\u2019s been in our shoes.\u201d\n\nDefending the Disparaged\n\nWith tattoos commemorating his recovery, Dr. Clark runs the office with his girlfriend, Natalie Tombs, also a recovering addict. Emotive and animated, Ms. Tombs has festooned the walls with inspirational messages on butterflies and hearts and signs warning against sharing, trading or selling medication: \u201cANY PATIENT CAN BE SUBJECTED TO RANDOM PILL COUNTS.\u201d\n\nThe couple portray themselves as the defenders of a disparaged segment of society with which they commiserate. Their patients see them that way, too.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cAs you know, my pharmacist thinks you\u2019re pretty much a joke, and he\u2019s not filling your prescriptions,\u201d one patient, James Markeley, said recently. \u201cI brought one in, handed it to him and said, \u2018How long will it be?\u2019 He said, \u2018It won\u2019t be.\u2019 \u201d\n\nDr. Clark giggled. \u201cWhat\u2019d he say again?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m an old hippie? I like that one.\u201d\n\nIt was not always so.\n\nA graduate of the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Dr. Clark did a fellowship in child psychiatry at Yale, served as an Air Force doctor in Germany and then took a job at a Pennsylvania hospital.\n\nIn the late 1990s, unhappy and overwhelmed by his patient load, he prescribed himself Adderall, a stimulant. His mood improved, and he focused better. But he kept taking more to get the same effect. After two years, he was a wreck.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Clark checked himself into a rehabilitation program in 1999.\n\n\u201cI had to cold-turkey it,\u201d he said. \u201cWithdrawal from amphetamines is different. It\u2019s much more tolerable than from opioids. After detox, though, the obsession and craving for the drug are similar. The relapse rates are similar. The triggers are similar. I had to learn to manage stress better, to rest better, to improve my self-esteem.\u201d\n\nDr. Clark also had to meet the demands of Pennsylvania\u2019s physician recovery program: therapy as well as five 12-step meetings and two random urine screens a week.\n\nAfter a few sober years, he relapsed when his marriage was breaking up. He wrote himself a prescription for painkillers in his son\u2019s name. His wife notified his program advocate.\n\n\u201cJust how much pain is your son in?\u201d the advocate asked.\n\nIn 2002, a second residential program gave him a diagnosis of depression and narcissistic personality disorder \u2014 he disagreed \u2014 and discharged him early with a poor prognosis. He agreed to take a reprieve from practicing medicine in Pennsylvania; Ohio suspended his license.\n\nDeeply in debt, Dr. Clark was reduced to collecting food stamps until Pennsylvania let him return to medicine as a prison doctor in 2003.\n\nThat same year, after a positive drug test, Dr. Clark entered his third treatment program and promised himself it would be his last. He has been sober since, he said.\n\nHis troubles did not end with sobriety, though.\n\nPennsylvania suspended him for a month in 2010 because he failed to submit to three unannounced drug tests while on vacation. Ohio revoked his license in 2011 because he forged signatures verifying his attendance at 12-step meetings.\n\nVideo\n\nIn 2008, a Reckitt Benckiser representative approached Dr. Clark at a children\u2019s hospital, saying: \u201cThere\u2019s this great medicine, Suboxone. Why not get certified? It doesn\u2019t take much, and it\u2019s a nice thing to add to your practice,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Clark devised a treatment program based on federal guidelines, except he tailored it to what his working-class patients could afford. He mostly prescribed generic buprenorphine rather than the higher-priced Suboxone, which has an additive meant to deter abuse and is favored, though not mandated, by the guidelines.\n\nAnd he established monthly, rather than more frequent, office visits unless patients violated the rules. He decided to \u201ccut out the middleman\u201d by declining to accept insurance and set his fee at $150 a visit, with a couples\u2019 price of $100 a person.\n\n\u201cI made sure my price was the lowest of any of the clinics, and that\u2019s why people liked us in the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of my competitors were gouging them.\u201d\n\nWith his caseload limited to 100 by law, Dr. Clark quickly found himself turning away patients and searching for doctors who wanted to supplement their income by working part-time for him.\n\nHe hired the walk-in clinic doctor who monitored his urine drug screens, and an alternative medicine specialist who sees patients by Skype from Virginia. He also hired a 53-year-old internist shortly after a 25-year-old woman died of \u201cacute combined drug toxicity\u201d at the internist\u2019s home following an evening together at the Wicked Googly bar in Ligonier, Pa.\n\n\u201cHe told me he was feeling some heat in his area and needed to get out of town for a while,\u201d Dr. Clark said.\n\nAfter filing for bankruptcy protection with $1.5 million in debt early this year, the internist quit in May to run his own buprenorphine practice, saying he needed to make money fast, Dr. Clark said.\n\nDr. Clark scrambled to replace him so his patients would not be abandoned. They often are in this volatile field. Many of Dr. Clark\u2019s patients showed up on his doorstep after the authorities had put their previous doctors out of business.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat happened with both Angela Scotchel, 25, and Amanda Rogers, 32. They are like before and after pictures. Ms. Scotchel, a former basketball star, is relatively fragile in her recovery, while Ms. Rogers appears firmly entrenched in hers despite a tempestuous personal life.\n\n\u2018A Classy User\u2019\n\nIn certain lights, Ms. Rogers, with her long blond hair and cornflower blue eyes, looks like the cheerleader she was, before the people closest to her started dying from drugs and she developed a yearslong habit.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cI never shot up; I always snorted,\u201d she said in March at her home in Toronto, Ohio. \u201cI called myself a classy user. I always made sure the kids were taken care of and the bills were paid first.\u201d\n\nIn Steubenville, where Ms. Rogers grew up, drugs were everywhere, and almost everybody in her life was an addict: her mother and stepfather, who suffered fatal overdoses; her younger sisters; her best friend; and her boyfriend.\n\n\u201cThat town is like poison,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve probably lost close to 25 friends in the past 10 years.\u201d\n\nShe was 21 and devastated by her mother\u2019s death when she started seeking solace in the \u201cnerve pills\u201d her mother left behind. She became so dysfunctional that she lost custody of her first child to relatives, she said, then quit the pills, had a second child and sought help for back pain and fibromyalgia from a local doctor.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know he was a pill pusher at the time,\u201d she said of the doctor, who was forced into retirement by the medical authorities in 2010. \u201cHe\u2019d get people hooked and then kick them out to hunt for drugs on the street. And once you\u2019re on the street, heroin is cheaper than pills and lasts longer. I loved it.\u201d\n\nFearful she would end up killing herself, she found a Suboxone doctor she could afford and placed her first tablet under her tongue on Sept. 21, 2009. She has been clean since, she said proudly, despite traumas that tested her resolve.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn June 2012, her younger sister Tiffany was released from a court-mandated, abstinence-based rehabilitation program. She glowed, Ms. Rogers said. But returning to Steubenville, with temptation all around, proved too much for her. Ms. Rogers said, \u201cShe was crying and crying, bawling, saying, \u2018Mandy, I\u2019m craving.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWithin a week, Tiffany was dead at 26 of \u201cacute cardiac and respiratory distress due to opioid abuse and dependency,\u201d her death certificate said.\n\n\u201cWhen I got that news, it was like with my mom,\u201d Ms. Rogers said. \u201cI just wanted to get in bed and stop trying.\u201d\n\nThis time, though, she ran a household filled with the grief and need of her sister\u2019s traumatized children and of her own. So she coped. Then her Suboxone doctor lost his license for excessive narcotics prescribing, and she had to forage for medication on the street until Dr. Clark\u2019s office called in April with an unexpected opening.\n\nBefore Ms. Rogers\u2019s first appointment with him, her 2-year-old played boisterously as she described feeling achy and nauseous. Her buprenorphine supply had run out and withdrawal had begun.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for my pain, I might tough it out,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if I went off the Subs, I\u2019d have to go back on painkillers, and I\u2019m not going back down that road.\u201d\n\nA few hours later, clasping a heart pendant containing a vial of her sister\u2019s ashes, she told Dr. Clark with tearful defiance that she would not let her children or her sister\u2019s children follow in their parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 footsteps.\n\n\u201cI want to break that cycle,\u201d she said.\n\nA Basketball Star\u2019s Fall\n\nAngela Scotchel was a first-generation user, but her family clung to her as she self-destructed. For her mother, Connie, that included lying by her side on the nights she overdosed to make sure she did not stop breathing. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t call an ambulance every single time,\u201d Connie Scotchel said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOnce a week, Mrs. Scotchel, a small-business owner with her husband, drives her daughter to Dr. Clark\u2019s office outside Pittsburgh from Morgantown to ensure she gets there and uses their hard-earned cash to pay the doctor and buy the medication. At home, Mrs. Scotchel keeps the buprenorphine in a locked safe and dispenses it dose by dose.\n\nIn her daily uniform of basketball shorts, Angela looks more like the point guard who used to squat 300 pounds than the scrawny addict who worked for an escort service to pay for her substantial heroin habit.\n\n\u201cI would never do anything like that sober in a million years,\u201d Angela said. \u201cIt was always men in their 40s, 50s and 60s, doctors and lawyers. Me being gay, it was especially disgusting. But I didn\u2019t care as long as I got high.\u201d\n\nDuring her senior year of high school, playing a rival team in a packed gym, Angela stole a ball right before halftime, tore down the court, leapt for a layup and was smacked down by an opposing player. A hush blanketed the crowd. She had torn an anterior cruciate ligament. And though she recovered to start on a college team, she soon tore another ligament. After two surgeries, she felt she had lost her game. She also developed a taste for painkillers.\n\n\u201cA lot of people said I could go pro, play overseas,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I gave it all up for drugs. Every time I used, I hated myself. I felt like I had let everybody down. I wanted to die.\u201d\n\nOver lasagna at their home, her parents talked about how bad things got: the times she disappeared, stole money from them, crashed cars, dangerously mixed heroin and Xanax. \u201cI can\u2019t count the number of times the police and the municipality walked up these steps,\u201d Mrs. Scotchel said. \u201cThey assisted us with her overdoses time and time again. I\u2019d have to follow her to the hospital. They\u2019d shackle her. I\u2019d be there all night waiting.\u201d\n\nPutting down her fork, Angela Scotchel cried. \u201cI went from a superstar to this lowdown dirty addict,\u201d she said.\n\nShe first tried Suboxone in Dr. Sullivan\u2019s clinic, which is 10 minutes from her home. But it made her ill. She thought she might be allergic to the additive in Suboxone and asked for plain buprenorphine. The clinic said no. She dropped out.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThey lived by the white coat there,\u201d her mother said, \u201cwhile Dr. Clark is like one of the addicts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAngela\u2019s heroin dealer stocked plain buprenorphine, so she tried it. It made her feel great, not sick, she said, so she found a doctor willing to prescribe it last year. After six months, she and her mother arrived at his office to find federal agents in windbreakers.\n\n\u201cWe watched the D.E.A. go in and out, and I said, \u2018Angela, he\u2019s busted,\u2019 \u201d Mrs. Scotchel said. \u201cPoor Angela was crying, thinking she was going to get sick again.\u201d\n\nThey drove to Dr. Clark\u2019s office, even though they knew his waiting list was long. Seeing how distraught Angela was, the doctor took her on. Early this year, Angela confessed to Dr. Clark that she was injecting her buprenorphine and mixing it with Xanax. He threatened to discharge her unless she stopped immediately. She did.\n\nMrs. Scotchel insisted that Dr. Clark see her daughter weekly, even though they are uninsured and it adds $3,000 to the yearly cost. The doctor gives her a $20 discount for each Narcotics Anonymous meeting she writes up in her journal.\n\nDuring her daughter\u2019s appointments, Mrs. Scotchel prefers to wait outside in her Subaru Forester, reading her Bible. \u201cWhen I go in there, I gawk,\u201d she said. \u201cIt should be a reality show.\u201d\n\nPolicing Prescriptions\n\nOn a typical day last spring, Dr. Clark\u2019s waiting room was a tangle of mothers and babies, interlocked girlfriends and boyfriends, bikers in leather and miners with their names on their shirts. As conversation snippets made clear, they were wrestling with eviction notices and restraining orders, insurance headaches and custody problems, parole officers and abusive spouses.\n\n\u201cIf he comes back and says, \u2018I\u2019ve got a gun,\u2019 I\u2019ll load up my 12-gauge and it will be war! \u201d said a patient with purple-streaked hair, mascara dripping down her cheeks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnother woman, juggling two small children, car keys and a lit cigarette, told the office manager she was broke.\n\n\u201cI just gave you guys my last money, and I\u2019m out of diapers and don\u2019t got gas,\u201d she said. The manager returned $25 to her and told her to get home safely.\n\nEmployees wandered about in shorts and flip-flops, shouting, \u201cCan I have a pee cup, please?\u201d Many are recovering addicts themselves, like Thomas Walleck, who staffs the drug testing station, in front of the Wall of Lost Souls \u2014 a collage of celebrities who died of overdoses.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Walleck, gentle and raspy-voiced, said he led patients to believe that his tests were all powerful so they would be forthright.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll also tell them Doc has kicked out 180 people for dishonesty; I exaggerate,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we got to know if they\u2019re dirty for their own good. And if they admit it, it\u2019s good for the bottom line, too. Because then they have to come back in two weeks, and that\u2019s another $100.\u201d\n\nMonitoring patients is a delicate task. Dr. Clark summons them for surprise pill counts; a sign in his office offers \u201cCASH and FREE VISIT rewards for information leading to the prosecution of those who are engaging in illegal activity regarding their Suboxone/Subutex prescriptions.\u201d\n\nYet this policing clashes with the doctor\u2019s fierce instinct to take his patients\u2019 side and to confide in them about, say, his own reliance on antidepressants or his girlfriend\u2019s routine of reading recovery books while eating licorice in bed.\n\nMs. Tombs, the girlfriend, gets frustrated with his penchant for giving his patients second, third and fourth chances. After he wrote a 30-day buprenorphine prescription for a young man who had admitted to dealing cocaine, Ms. Tombs angrily drew 1,000 stick figures to illustrate those on their waiting list.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI had to sleep in the office for three days,\u201d Dr. Clark said.\n\nUsually the two are united against outside forces: the police who keep a too-watchful eye on their parking lot, the child protection workers who do not consider buprenorphine users drug free, the pharmacists who hassle their patients.\n\nDr. Clark has frequently felt under siege. He said a Reckitt Benckiser representative cautioned him that he was courting trouble with the authorities by prescribing generic buprenorphine and not Suboxone. Last year, Dr. Clark wrote the Drug Enforcement Administration to ask whether he was indeed tempting fate.\n\nA senior D.E.A. official responded that \u201cwhat drug to prescribe, what formulation, what quantity\u201d was a doctor\u2019s prerogative.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate to learn that physicians in Western Pennsylvania have received incorrect information,\u201d the official wrote, \u201cand that such misinformation may potentially be inhibiting legitimate treatment.\u201d\n\nFeeling vindicated, Dr. Clark circulated the letter to pharmacists. But they were concerned, too, about the amounts he was prescribing. While within federal guidelines, his doses were on average twice those of Dr. Sullivan\u2019s.\n\nMany of his patients, having flooded their bodies with potent opioids for years, need high doses, Dr. Clark said. Indeed, he noted, studies have shown higher treatment retention rates for people getting higher doses.\n\nPhoto\n\nDr. Sullivan, though, spoke with frustration about \u201cprescribing wars\u201d in Pittsburgh between \u201centrepreneurial doctors\u201d who were \u201cnaively or maliciously overprescribing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cPatients will take what they need and sell the rest. And once the medicine is on the street, for the D.E.A., it looks just like heroin: part of the problem. It blows back on all of us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA Structured Program\n\nEarly this year, Dr. Sullivan invited the United States attorney for the Northern District of West Virginia to visit his clinic, which with its mushroom-colored walls and white-coated professionals inspires a kind of institutional hush.\n\nThe federal prosecutor, William J. Ihlenfeld II, said he was eager to be \u201cenlightened\u201d given that West Virginia has the country\u2019s second highest rate of overdose deaths and that a fifth of its babies have been exposed to drugs or alcohol in the womb.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken the approach in our office that we can\u2019t just arrest our way out of the problems we\u2019re facing with prescription drugs and heroin,\u201d Mr. Ihlenfeld said. Before his visit, he felt \u201csomewhat close-minded about how effective something like this can be\u201d given that he had \u201cheard a lot of people in law enforcement complain\u201d about buprenorphine.\n\nWhat he saw inspired him, though, he said: \u201cPeople benefiting, from a coal miner to a restaurant owner to somebody who had had ankle surgery and got sucked into addiction.\u201d\n\nDr. Sullivan\u2019s program, a showcase for buprenorphine treatment, is as regimented as Dr. Clark\u2019s is free form. New patients must attend one 90-minute session at the hospital plus four 12-step recovery meetings a week until they achieve 90 continuous days of sobriety, which usually takes half a year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no data to support it, but people who go to meetings get better,\u201d Dr. Sullivan said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just give addicts a pill, pat them on the head and expect them to turn things around for themselves. These people live very complicated and messy lives.\u201d\n\nThe new patients often inquire how long they will have to take buprenorphine. Once stable, though, they stop asking, realizing the answer is \u201cmaybe forever,\u201d Dr. Sullivan said.\n\n\u201cForever seems like a nice alternative to dead,\u201d his patient Joellen Trippett, 48, said dryly.\n\nAt a staff meeting one day last spring, a case manager asked Dr. Sullivan how he wanted to handle a younger woman who was vigorously denying her pharmacy\u2019s report that she had sought to fill a prescription for Oxycodone.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI guess we\u2019ll do an observed on her,\u201d Dr. Sullivan said, referring to a monitored urine test.\n\n\u201cAn observed?\u201d the case manager said. \u201cHow about a discharge?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nRelapses are plentiful \u2014 12 of 50 patients that day \u2014 but patients are expelled only if they lie. Confronting the woman in her therapy group, Dr. Sullivan said that \u201csurreptitious use of opioids is not permitted\u201d and dismissed her with a prescription for one week of Suboxone.\n\nUnlike Dr. Clark, Dr. Sullivan does not meet with patients individually. It would not be cost-effective; more than half of the clinic\u2019s patients are covered by Medicaid. Instead, he relies on therapists like Katie Chiasson, whose \u201cadvanced\u201d group \u2014 those clean of drugs for at least a year and therefore required to come only monthly \u2014 was full of angst one day last spring.\n\nBetty Jo Cumberledge, 47, announced in a trembling voice that she had just gotten a text from a fellow patient seeking to buy some of her Suboxone.\n\n\u201cTell them that if they don\u2019t stop, you will expose them in group,\u201d Ms. Trippett said.\n\nMs. Chiasson asked how they could set boundaries.\n\n\u201cWe all need to protect our medicine,\u201d Ms. Trippett said. \u201cIt gets stolen out of our cars and homes.\u201d She added that while selling Suboxone would be profitable, she did not want to return to the life she used to lead: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a cheat. I don\u2019t want to be a thief. I don\u2019t want to be a liar.\u201d\n\nChelsea Kennedy, 21, skinny and pregnant with her second child, reported that seven Suboxone dealers had been arrested in her town the previous week, and talked about her friend who gets a Suboxone prescription in Pittsburgh without even seeing the doctor \u2014 \u201cand she\u2019s selling, shooting, buying, running the streets.\u201d\n\nMs. Cumberledge threw up her hands: \u201cIt\u2019s these kind of people who are hurting us.\u201d\n\nA Disease\u2019s Tentacles\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn late spring, Dr. Clark, still on probation, got an anxiety-provoking visit from a state medical investigator. Some pharmacists had complained about his prescribing practices, which led to the discovery that Dr. Clark had violated his 2010 suspension by continuing to write prescriptions for three buprenorphine patients he had not been able to place with other doctors.\n\nWhen the investigator arrived, Mr. Smith was there. It made him nervous. He was already rattled, dealing with a job change and a custody battle, and did not want to contemplate losing Dr. Clark. \u201cI\u2019d be tossed right back out onto the street to buy drugs,\u201d he said.\n\nAddiction is a tenacious disease with tentacles \u2014 family problems, legal problems, financial problems \u2014 that do not disappear with sobriety. Recovery has its zigs and zags, which many of the patients interviewed experienced this summer and fall.\n\nAngela Scotchel, overwhelmed by anxiety about her future, constantly craved and sometimes gave in to her desire for Xanax. She also heard the siren call of opiates even as she set out to engage in life-affirming pursuits like lifting weights, working for her parents, dating.\n\n\u201cThis one dealer called me today and said he got some fire in,\u201d she wrote in an email, referring to high-potency heroin. \u201cI can\u2019t get it out of my head. I\u2019m not gonna act on it, though. Just threw me off. I needed to tell someone about it.\u201d\n\nMs. Rogers rode a roller coaster of life changes. She broke up with her partner of 21 years and got involved with another man. She found a job as a cashier and lost it because of unreliable babysitters. She placed her late sister\u2019s children in a therapeutic foster home. She reluctantly moved back to Steubenville for lower-priced housing. She became pregnant with her fourth child.\n\nDr. Clark, meanwhile, prepared himself for the possibility that he could lose his license. He aggressively recruited other doctors, figuring he could manage the clinic. He watched the movie \u201cLincoln\u201d twice; it helped him \u201cdeal with \u2018the negativity.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI figure if Lincoln could fight for the rights of slaves during a time when many people thought this was practically criminal,\u201d he wrote in an email, \u201cthe least I can do is continue to fight for the rights of a few people suffering from the disease and stigma of addiction in my little part of the world.\u201d\n\nAt summer\u2019s end, though, his probation was lifted. He hired two New Jersey doctors, one a recovering addict, to see patients by Skype. His business grew fatter while he grew leaner, shedding 20 pounds and his sense of dread.\n\n\u201cI feel like I got de-stigmatized,\u201d Dr. Clark said. \u201cLike now I got nothing to hide, nothing to fear, and there\u2019s hope for me and hope for all my patients. But we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Double-Edged Drug: The second of two articles examining the increasing use \u2014 and the successes and failures \u2014 of buprenorphine as an addiction treatment.
