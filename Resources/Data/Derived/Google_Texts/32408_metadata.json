Ted Cruz, R-Texas, cited an example of an employer cutting back on health coverage as a result of the law.\n\nCruz said: \"Just a few weeks ago, UPS sent a letter to some 15,000 employees saying, \u2018We are dropping spousal health insurance because of Obamacare.\u2019 That is 15,000 UPS employees who had insurance for their husbands and wives, and suddenly those husbands and wives are left without health insurance and being told, \u2018Go on an exchange with no employer subsidy.\u2019 \"\n\nWe thought we\u2019d check exactly what UPS, the major package carrier, did with its health insurance coverage.\n\nThe full memo announcing the decision can be found here . Here are the key elements:\n\n\u2022 If a UPS employee is on the company\u2019s plan and their spouse is employed at a different company that offers health insurance, the spouse will no longer be eligible for the UPS plan and must purchase insurance from their own employer.\n\n\u2022 If a UPS employee is on the company\u2019s plan and their spouse is not employed by a company that offers health insurance (or isn\u2019t employed at all, or is on a government plan such as Medicare), then the spouse will remain on the UPS plan.\n\n\u2022 The company estimates that of the 77,000 UPS employees who are enrolled in UPS health insurance, about 33,000 currently have spouses enrolled in the plan. Of those, the company estimates that 15,000 current UPS spousal enrollees may have to take their employer\u2019s coverage -- roughly one in five of all enrollees.\n\n\u2022 Spouses whose employers offer medical insurance but do not offer prescription drug coverage or behavioral health benefits will not be allowed to remain on the UPS plan.\n\n\u2022 After the change, if a spouse shifts from being unemployed (and thus eligible for the UPS plan) to a job with insurance coverage, they must drop the UPS coverage and take their new employer\u2019s coverage.\n\n\u2022 Children may remain on the UPS plan. If both parents have plans from different companies, the parents can choose which plan will cover their children. Stepchildren who are children of a spouse being removed from the UPS plan may remain on the UPS plan.\n\n\u2022 The UPS memo specifically cited Obamacare as a factor in its decision: \"Limiting plan eligibility is one way to manage ongoing health care costs. \u2026 This change is consistent with the way many large employers are responding to the costs associated with the health care reform legislation.\"\n\nSo UPS did change its policy on insuring spouses of employees, a change that will affect an estimated 15,000 people. But Cruz is wrong that the UPS spouses would be \"without health insurance\" and would have to \"go on an exchange with no employer subsidy.\"\n\nIn reality, the only spouses that would be removed from the UPS plan would be those that already had an option of purchasing employer coverage. They wouldn\u2019t be without health insurance. They wouldn\u2019t have to go on an Obamacare exchange. And their employer would be paying part of their premiums.\n\nOur ruling\n\nCruz said that by dropping spousal health insurance for 15,000 employees, UPS left employees\u2019 spouses \"without health insurance\" and told them to, \"go on an exchange with no employer subsidy.\"\n\nBut Cruz ignores that the only spouses being kicked off the UPS plan would be the ones who already had access to an employer-sponsored plan in their own job. This means they wouldn\u2019t be \"without health insurance\" and wouldn\u2019t have to find coverage on an Obamacare marketplace.
