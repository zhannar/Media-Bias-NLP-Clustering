The hip-hopification of Obama’s presidency reached new heights Monday when Broadway’s Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda joined the president in the Rose Garden and performed a rap song about random civic terminology.

The two-minute freestyle session saw President Obama holding up cards with the words “Constitution,” “Obamacare,” and “NASA,” written on them. As Obama flipped the cards, Miranda rapped lyrics off the top of his head about the key words.

“Constitution, the POTUS, I’m freestylin.’ You know this,” he sang as seen in the video clip posted to the White House Facebook page.

The Grammy-winning Hamilton cast also mingled with first lady Michelle Obama. The first lady had the cast perform for a group of high schoolers visiting the White House.

Monday wasn’t Miranda’s first visit to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Six years ago, Miranda performed the song “Alexander Hamilton” in the East Room of the White House.
