Homeless people or homeowners who\u2019ve been foreclosed upon can apply for an exemption. So can those whose utilities have been shut off, who have suffered domestic violence or who have experienced a death in their families.\n\nIn December, the administration said people whose existing health plans had been canceled wouldn\u2019t have to comply with the mandate. Last week, the government said that exemption will be extended through 2016. In a catch-all category, anybody who believes they\u2019ve had a \u201chardship in obtaining insurance\u201d can apply for an exemption -- documentation is optional.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a consumer and you\u2019re looking at this, it leaves a lot of ambiguity,\u201d Dan Mendelson, the president of Avalere Health, a Washington consulting firm, said by telephone. \u201cYou don\u2019t know if you qualify for a hardship exemption but you are very likely to fall into one of these categories -- or are able to get into one of these categories.\u201d\n\nRepublican opponents of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act said the law\u2019s individual mandate is so riddled with exemptions that it\u2019s almost impossible to run afoul of it. They have pressed the Obama administration to formally lift it. House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, said the administration may have intentionally gutted its own mandate.\n\n\u2018Huge\u2019 Decision\n\n\u201cQuietly, without any fanfare, there\u2019s a real question about whether the White House has just abandoned the individual mandate, the heart of Obamacare itself,\u201d Boehner said yesterday at a news conference. \u201cThis is a huge public policy decision that could affect millions of Americans.\u201d\n\nThe Republican-controlled House voted 238-181 today to repeal the individual mandate for five years in order to finance a new system to pay doctors who participate in Medicare, the U.S. health program for the elderly and disabled. The bill won\u2019t pass the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats, and Obama has said he would veto it.\n\nRepealing the mandate \u201cwould result in higher numbers of uninsured Americans, higher premiums for those who remain insured, and fewer premium tax credits for middle-income families, and would increase cost-shifting of uncompensated care to health-care providers, workers, and businesses,\u201d the White House said in a memo opposing the House bill.\n\nGreater Coverage\n\nThe goal of the 2010 Affordable Care Act is to provide access to health coverage for the nation\u2019s estimated 48 million uninsured. Major provisions took effect Jan. 1, including the sale of health plans through new government insurance marketplaces. More than 4.2 million Americans have enrolled in private health insurance through the exchanges, the administration said this week.\n\nNo provision of the law is more controversial than the individual mandate, a concept that even Obama didn\u2019t support until after he was elected president. Health insurers have said that to remain financially viable while offering coverage to everyone, regardless of whether they are sick as the law maintains, the government also must require all Americans to obtain insurance. The theory is that premiums from young and healthy people who don\u2019t need much medical care can balance the risk and cost of caring for those who are older or unhealthy.\n\nConcerns Raised\n\n\u201cWe have consistently raised concerns about any effort to sever the link between insurance market reforms and the individual mandate,\u201d Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the industry\u2019s Washington lobby group, said in an e-mail.\n\nMost Americans don\u2019t have to worry about the law\u2019s mandate because they\u2019re covered by health plans offered by employers or government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Only about 5 percent of the population bought insurance for themselves in 2012, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a Menlo Park, California-based nonprofit group that studies health-care issues.\n\nWith just weeks until the March 31 enrollment deadline for 2014, the Obama administration has begun warning Americans that a penalty will apply if they don\u2019t carry insurance starting April 1. The government publicly released the form Americans must use to apply for an exemption late on Dec. 19, as part of regulatory guidance. It wasn\u2019t accompanied by a news release.\n\n\u2018Hardship\u2019 Cases\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act requires people who can afford insurance to buy it, so that their medical bills are not passed onto the rest of us, which drives up health-care costs for everyone,\u201d Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the Health and Human Services Department, said in an e-mail. The form \u201callows a limited number of individuals who are facing hardship to apply for an exception. This exception also makes it easier to find insurance by allowing those individuals to access catastrophic-level plans.\u201d\n\nBefore enrollment began in October, administration officials had said they hoped to meet a Congressional Budget Office enrollment target of 7 million people in private plans in 2014. The CBO revised that estimate to 6 million in February.\n\nThere are 14 categories of exemptions, including one covering low-income people who have been denied Medicaid coverage in the 25 states that have declined to expand that program under the health-care law. That population alone may number about 5 million, according to the Kaiser foundation.\n\nFirm Deadline\n\nU.S. Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius reiterated earlier this week that the administration will neither extend the March 31 deadline to sign up for Affordable Care Act plans or lift the mandate to carry coverage. People liable for the mandate who don\u2019t have insurance will pay fines, in the form of extra taxes next year, amounting to as much as 1 percent of their income. Exemptions from the mandate will be decided on a case-by-case basis, the government said.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that the administration has tried to make the mandate easy to avoid, said Joseph Antos, a health economist at the nonprofit American Enterprise Institute who advises the Congressional Budget Office. Mendelson, of Avalere Health, said the government would be wise to clarify who is likely to be approved for an exemption.\n\n\u201cThey know that the individual mandate will be very hard to enforce, and the penalty for not complying both difficult to determine and politically disastrous to try to collect,\u201d Antos said in an e-mail. The government\u2019s published list of exemptions, he said, is probably intended \u201cto give people who don\u2019t like the mandate ideas of how they can avoid it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Wayne", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-13/millions-may-avoid-obamacare-penalty-as-deadline-looms", "title": "Millions May Avoid Obamacare Penalty as Deadline Looms", "description": "Obamacare\u2019s requirement that all Americans carry insurance or face penalties, part of the effort to gain universal coverage, may not be much of a rule at all.", "card": "summary", "site": "@business"}, "parsely-author": "Alex Wayne", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Law,Health", "news_keywords": "Law,Health", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-13/millions-may-avoid-obamacare-penalty-as-deadline-looms", "parsely-title": "Millions May Avoid Obamacare Penalty as Deadline Looms", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-03-14T17:21:18.834Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Obamacare\u2019s requirement that all Americans carry insurance or face penalties, part of the effort to gain universal coverage, may not be much of a rule at all.", "parsely-tags": "Law,Health,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-03-14T17:21:18.834Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-13/millions-may-avoid-obamacare-penalty-as-deadline-looms", "type": "website", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Obamacare\u2019s requirement that all Americans carry insurance or face penalties, part of the effort to gain universal coverage, may not be much of a rule at all.", "title": "Millions May Avoid Obamacare Penalty as Deadline Looms"}, "fb": {"status": "Obamacare\u2019s requirement that all Americans carry insurance or face penalties, part of the effort to gain universal coverage, may not be much of a rule at all."}, "parsely-post-id": "N2DX5B6JTSEE01", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "article_summary": "Millions of people may be exempt from the requirement known as the individual mandate under rules issued by the Obama administration.\nIn December, the administration said people whose existing health plans had been canceled wouldn\u2019t have to comply with the mandate.\n\u2018Huge\u2019 Decision\u201cQuietly, without any fanfare, there\u2019s a real question about whether the White House has just abandoned the individual mandate, the heart of Obamacare itself,\u201d Boehner said yesterday at a news conference.\nThey have pressed the Obama administration to formally lift it.\nMajor provisions took effect Jan. 1, including the sale of health plans through new government insurance marketplaces."}
