Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” radio talk show host Glenn Beck likened Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler in an interview with host George Stephanopoulos.

Partial transcript as follows:

BECK: The GOP has one last chance to listen to the people. Um, and the people that — and I understand it. They’re very, very angry because the GOP did not listen the first time around. They didn’t listen to the Ron Paul people who are way ahead of the curve. Then the Tea Party people they rubbed our nose in it, and they are tired, and they have created Donald Trump. The people are speaking clearly. And there’s two ways to go. Anger and nationalism. Nationalism has been done before in history. You can go for nationalism. You can go for anger.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Trump is Adolf Hitler?

BECK: If you look what is happening with Donald Trump and his playing to the lowest common denominator and the anger in us. You know, Adolf Hitler — we all look at Adolf Hitler in 1940. We should look at him in 1929. He was the kind of funny, character that said the things that people were thinking. Where Donald Trump takes it, I have absolutely no idea. But, Donald Trump is a dangerous man with the things he’s been saying. Now, the GOP is playing unbelievable games right now. Trying to make sure they get their way. And they’re trying to go for a brokered convention. I’m against Donald Trump. But I’ll tell you one thing, if he gets close enough, and the GOP tries to play games, I won’t vote for Donald Trump ever, but I’ll stand with his right because the people have spoken. And what the GOP is doing, they’re stirring things up because they’re more afraid of Ted Cruz than Donald Trump.
