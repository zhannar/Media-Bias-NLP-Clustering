On Fox & Friends weekend edition, conservative pundit Ann Coulter told cohost Tucker Carlson that her friend’s sister had passed away over the weekend after putting off medical attention because she had lost her insurance coverage under Obamacare.

“This does have real world consequences: I got up the other morning and got an email from a friend saying, ‘My sister almost died because of Obamacare,'” Coulter said.

Coulter said the friend’s sister was kicked off her insurance when Blue Shield pulled out of California, put off going to emergency room despite having a fever because she didn’t have insurance, until she went into septic shock on Thursday. Over the weekend, the friend passed away.

“That is completely shocking,” Tucker Carlson said.

“But it isn’t,” Coulter responded. “It’s expected. We knew this would happen. It’s a horrible story, and people need to know about these stories. I emailed her and asked her if I could tweet this, and she said, ‘Julie would be very happy for you to tweet this.'”
