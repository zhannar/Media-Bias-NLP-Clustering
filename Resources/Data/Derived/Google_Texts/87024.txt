WASHINGTON (CBS/AP) — A Supreme Court ruling due in late June could wipe out health insurance for millions of people covered by the president’s health care law.

But it is Republicans — and not White House officials — who are talking about damage control.

If that sounds wrong, check the math.

Twenty-six of the 34 states that would be most affected by the ruling have Republican governors. And 22 of the 24 GOP Senate seats up for election next year are in those states.

Obama’s law offers subsidized private insurance to people not covered on the job.

In the court case, opponents of the law argue that its literal wording allows subsidies only in states that set up their own health insurance markets. Most Republican-leaning states have not done so.
