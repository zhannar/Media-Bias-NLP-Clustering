Selena Gomez, "Revival" (Interscope Records)

Sophomore albums are notoriously tricky propositions, but Selena Gomez's second solo venture, "Revival," breezes through to the finish line — the dance floor —with 11 nearly impeccable tracks that skip from the 1960s to the '80s to right this minute.

On "Revival," Gomez continues her foray into a heady mix of electronic dance music pop accessorized with rapping from A$AP Rocky, writing from Charli XCX, soulful pianos, steel drums, and her own chameleon voice, showcasing her pipes in the piano-accompanied "Hands to Myself" and with warm, rich vocals in the serious yet jubilant "Revival."

The first single from the album, "Good for You," her biggest hit to date, is a subtle electro tune. But the song's flow suffers with A$AP Rocky's bewildering (if trendy) interlude — a minor hiccup on an otherwise seamless album. "Same Old Love" starts off with a whimsical '60s feel, but morphs into a punchy bass dance track.

"Body Heat" is on odd saxophone infused Latino drum dance floor scorcher, but it's "Survivors" that true trance-house addicts will fall for. "Kill Them With Kindness" is an approachable dance track with added bells and whistles (literally), while "Sober" brings '80s synthesizers to the fore.
