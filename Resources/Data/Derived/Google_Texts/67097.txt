A small, Denver-based nonprofit with ties to Nepal has started a disaster relief fund in the wake of Saturday’s massive, deadly earthquake.

The Colorado Nepal Alliance has been donating boots and shoes to villages in Nepal for about three years and recently began building a classroom for a needy school in the Darkha region — a collection of villages, said alliance executive director Anne Hines.

“We have not been able to reach any of the people that work with us in Nepal since the earthquake,” Hines said.

Hines knows from other contacts in the area that most buildings have collapsed and that many people have died.

Hines worries that small villages like those in the Darkha region will be ignored as far as disaster relief in favor of the more densely populated regions.

Because the nonprofit is volunteer-based and small, Hines said they are incapable of doing immediate disaster relief, but have set up a relief fund to help families in the Darkha region rebuild a few months down the road.

One hundred percent of the contributions will go to families most in need, she said.

“Even very small contributions can go a long way in a country like Nepal,” Hines said. “Even $10 can help a family out quite a bit.”

Larry Leszczynski , a cofounder of the Colorado Nepal Alliance, said that many in Colorado feel strongly about Nepal.

“There’s a lot of people in Colorado that have an affinity for Nepal because of the mountains and climbing and outdoorsmanship of most Coloradans,” he said. “We’re just trying to find a way to let people participate and make a difference.”
