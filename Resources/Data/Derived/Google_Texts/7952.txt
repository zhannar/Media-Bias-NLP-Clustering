To our readers: The future of the Supreme Court. The most far-right presidential candidates in decades. Non-stop attacks on women’s rights. Never has the work of Right Wing Watch, a project of the People For the American Way dedicated to exposing the Far-Right's extreme and intolerant agenda, been more important. And, as a non-profit, our main source of support is readers like you. If you use Right Wing Watch, please consider making a contribution to support our work at this critical time.
