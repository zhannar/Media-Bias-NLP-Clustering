Our unemployment rate is below five percent for the first time in almost eight years. Nearly 18 million people have gained health coverage as the Affordable Care Act has taken effect. And we have dramatically cut our deficits by almost three-quarters and set our Nation on a more sustainable fiscal path.\n\nYet while it is important to take stock of our progress, this Budget is not about looking back at the road we have traveled. It is about looking forward and making sure our economy works for everybody, not just those at the top. It is about choosing investments that not only make us stronger today, but also reflect the kind of country we aspire to be \u2013 the kind of country we want to pass on to our children and grandchildren.\n\nThe Budget makes critical investments in our domestic and national security priorities while adhering to the bipartisan budget agreement signed into law last fall, and it lifts sequestration in future years so that we continue to invest in our economic future and our national security. It also drives down deficits and maintains our fiscal progress through smart savings from health care, immigration, and tax reforms.\n\nThe Budget shows that the President and the Administration remain focused on meeting our greatest challenges \u2013 including accelerating the pace of innovation to tackle climate change and find new treatments for devastating diseases; giving everyone a fair shot at opportunity and economic security; and advancing our national security and global leadership \u2013 not only for the year ahead, but for decades to come.\n\nBUILDING ON OUR ECONOMIC AND FISCAL PROGRESS\n\nThe Budget makes critical investments while adhering to the bipartisan budget agreement signed into law last fall. It lifts sequestration in 2018 and beyond so that we continue to invest in our economic future and our national security. It also drives down deficits and maintains our fiscal progress through smart savings from health care, immigration, and tax reforms.\n\nA Record of Job Growth and Economic Expansion. Under the President\u2019s leadership, the U.S. economy has become an engine of job growth and economic expansion, outpacing other advanced economies in recovery from the Great Recession. American businesses have added 14 million jobs over the past 71 months \u2013 the longest streak of job growth on record. Our unemployment rate is below five percent for the first time in almost eight years. And the economy added 903,000 new manufacturing jobs in the last six years \u2013 the first sustained job growth in the sector since the 1990s. Nearly 18 million Americans have gained health insurance under the Affordable Care Act and our high school graduation rate is at an all-time high.\n\nReflecting on Our Fiscal Progress. We have made remarkable economic and fiscal progress, showing what\u2019s possible when strategic investment to grow our economy is paired with smart reforms, for example to our health care system, that address the true drivers of our long-term fiscal challenges. Since 2009, under the President\u2019s leadership, Federal deficits have fallen by nearly three-quarters \u2013 the most rapid sustained defi\u00adcit reduction since just after World War II. The annual deficit in 2015 fell to 2.5 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the lowest level since 2007, and well below the average of the last 40 years.\n\nBuilding on Our Success for a Stronger Economy. The President\u2019s Budget continues that approach, investing in America\u2019s future and laying out a path to address our greatest challenges. It builds on the bipartisan budget agreement secured last fall, adhering to the discretionary levels provided for 2017, while also putting forward paid-for mandatory investments that are critical to building durable economic growth in the future and maintaining America\u2019s edge as the leader in innovation and cutting-edge science. The Budget proposes a number of reforms \u2013 including a detailed international tax reform plan \u2013 that would modernize the business tax code to make it fairer and more efficient, and to create jobs. The Budget also finishes the job the past two bipartisan agreements started by preventing the return of harmful sequestration funding levels in 2018 and beyond, replacing the savings by closing tax loopholes and reforming tax expenditures, and with smart spending reforms.\n\nInvesting in Economic Growth While Maintaining Fiscal Responsibility. The Budget more than pays for all new investments, achieving $2.9 trillion of deficit reduction over 10 years, from health, tax, and immigration reforms, and other proposals. The Budget includes roughly $375 billion of health savings that grow over time and builds on the ACA with further incentives to improve qual\u00adity and control health care cost growth. The Budget achieves more than $955 billion in deficit reduction from reducing tax benefits for high-income households, helping to bring in sufficient revenues to make vital investments while also helping to meet our promises to seniors. The Budget reflects the President\u2019s support for commonsense, comprehensive immigration reform along the lines of the 2013 bipartisan Senate-passed bill, which CBO has estimated would reduce the deficit by about $170 billion over 10 years and by almost $1 trillion over two decades.\n\nThe Budget keeps deficits below three percent of GDP while stabilizing debt and putting it on a declining path for most of the next decade \u2013 key measures of fiscal progress \u2013 showing that investments in growth and opportunity are compatible with putting the Nation\u2019s finances on a strong and sustainable path.\n\nINNOVATION TO FORGE A BETTER FUTURE\n\nThe Budget invests in accelerating the pace of American innovation, so we can create jobs and build the economy of the future while tackling our greatest challenges, including addressing climate change and finding new treatments and cures for devastating diseases. The Budget includes investments in:\n\nBuilding a 21st Century Transportation System. The Budget invests $320 billion over 10 years in a multi-agency initiative to build a clean transportation system for the 21st Century that speeds goods to market while reducing America\u2019s reliance on oil, cutting carbon pollution, and strengthening our resilience to the effects of the changing climate. Overall, the 21st Century Clean Transportation Plan will increase American investments in clean transportation infrastructure by roughly 50 percent above current levels while reforming the transportation investments already being made to move America to more sustainable, low-carbon investments.\n\nPrioritizing Research and Development. The Budget sustains the Administration\u2019s consistent prioritization of R&D with an invest\u00adment of $152 billion for R&D overall through both discretionary and mandatory funding proposals, a four percent increase from 2016.\n\nDoubling Clean Energy R&D. Since the President took office, the Administration has made the largest investments in clean energy in American history. The Budget provides $7.7 billion government-wide, a 20 percent increase over 2016, for fundamental and transformative clean energy R&D across 12 agencies, a first step in support of Mission Innovation, the landmark agreement currently among 20 countries to double government funding for clean energy R&D over five years.\n\nSince the President took office, the Administration has made the largest investments in clean energy in American history.

This amount includes $750 million in U.S. funding for the Green Climate Fund (GCF), which will help developing countries leverage public and private financing to invest in reducing carbon pollution and strengthening resilience to climate change.\n\nOPPORTUNITY FOR ALL\n\nAs the President stated in the 2016 State of the Union Address, one of the Nation\u2019s key challenges is how to give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and economic security. In today\u2019s global economy, our competitiveness depends on tapping the full potential of all Americans. To address this challenge, the Budget supports education; training and support for workers and their families; access to health care; and other investments to ensure that all Americans contribute to and benefit from our economic growth.\n\nImproving Access to High-Quality Child Care and Early Education. High-quality child care and early education for young children support parents in the workforce and help foster healthy child development and school readiness. The Budget aims to ensure that children have access to high-quality learning starting at birth by:\n\nExpanding access to quality child care for working families. The Budget ensures that all low- and moderate-income working families with young children have access to quality, affordable child care, as opposed to the small share of children who receive this help today.

This significant investment is based on recent rigorous research that found that families who utilized vouchers \u2013 compared to alternative forms of assistance to the homeless \u2013 had fewer incidents of homelessness, child separations, intimate partner violence and school moves, less food insecurity, and generally less economic stress.\n\nEnsuring Access to Quality, Affordable Health Care. The Budget supports the Affordable Care Act, which is already providing coverage for millions of Americans through the Health Insurance Marketplaces, the delivery of financial assistance to make coverage affordable, and the expansion of Medicaid. It also supports:\n\nExpanding Access to Mental Health Care. One in five American adults experience a men\u00adtal health issue at some point in their life, yet millions do not receive the care they need. The Budget includes $500 million in new mandatory funding to help engage individuals with serious mental illness in care, improve access to care by increasing service capacity and the behavioral health workforce, and ensure that behavioral health care systems work for everyone.\n\nOne in five American adults experience a men\u00adtal health issue at some point in their life, yet millions do not receive the care they need.

Addressing the Prescription Drug and Heroin Overdose Epidemic. More Americans now die every year from drug overdoses than they do in motor vehicle crashes. The Budget takes a two-pronged approach to address this epidemic. First, it includes $1 billion in new mandatory funding over two years to expand access to treatment for prescription drug abuse and heroin use and help ensure that every American who wants treatment can access it and get the help they need. Second, it includes funding to continue and increase current efforts to expand State-level prescription drug overdose prevention strategies, increase the availability of medication-assisted treatment programs, improve access to the overdose-reversal drug naloxone, and support targeted enforcement activities.\n\nIncentivizing Justice Reform with the 21st Century Justice Initiative. The Administration continues to support criminal justice reform that enhances public safety, avoids excessive punishment and unnecessary incarceration, and builds trust between the justice system and the community. The Budget includes a $5 billion investment for a new 21st Century Justice Initiative that will focus on achieving three objectives: reducing crime, reversing practices that have led to unnecessarily long sentences and unnecessary incarceration, and building community trust.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY AND GLOBAL LEADERSHIP\n\nEconomic growth and opportunity can only be achieved if America is safe and secure. The Budget provides the resources to address security threats wherever they arise and continue to demonstrate American leadership around the world.\n\nDestroying ISIL. The President\u2019s highest priority is keeping the American people safe. That is why the United States is leading the global coalition that will de\u00adstroy the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The Budget provides over $11 billion for the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of State to support U.S. efforts to continue to hunt down terrorists; provide training and equipment to forces fighting ISIL on the ground; help stabilize communities liberated from ISIL in Syria and Iraq; disrupt ISIL\u2019s financing and recruitment; strengthen our regional partners, provide humanitarian assistance to those impacted by the conflict; and support a political solution to the Syrian civil war.\n\nCountering Violent Extremism. The President\u2019s Budget includes funding for innovative, community-based approaches that seek to discourage violent extremism and to improve the ability of communities to identify potential extremists and intervene where necessary to thwart radical behavior that may lead to violence.\n\nSecuring the Digital Economy for All Americans Through Strengthened Cybersecurity. The Budget invests $19 billion in overall Federal resources for cybersecurity to support a broad-based cybersecurity strategy for securing the Government, enhancing the security of critical infrastructure and important technologies, investing in next-generation tools and workforce, and empowering Americans. In particular, this funding will support the Cybersecurity National Action Plan, which takes near-term actions and puts in place a long-term strategy to enhance cybersecurity awareness and protections, protect privacy, maintain public safety as well as economic and national security, and empower Americans to take better control of their digital security.\n\nSupporting the Transition in Afghanistan. The Budget includes resources to reinforce Afghanistan\u2019s security and development by supporting military training and assistance, as well as health, education, justice, economic growth, governance, and other civilian assistance programs necessary to promote stability and strengthen diplomatic ties with the international community. The Budget also supports the U.S. military mission to train, advise, and assist the Afghan National Security Forces and maintain a counterterrorism capability.\n\nCountering Russian Aggression and Supporting European Allies. The Budget includes $4.3 billion for political, economic, public diplomacy, and military support to build resilience and reduce vulnerabilities to Russian aggression among NATO allies and partner states in Europe, Eurasia, and Central Asia. As part of that effort the Budget includes $3.4 billion for the Department of Defense\u2019s European Reassurance Initiative (ERI).\n\nProviding Further Support for the Central American Regional Strategy. The Budget provides necessary resources to further support the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America by investing in a long-term, comprehensive approach designed to address the root causes of migration of unaccompanied children and families from the region.\n\nAdvancing the Rebalance to Asia and the Pacific. The Budget supports the Administration\u2019s commitment to a comprehensive regional strategy in Asia and the Pacific that reinforces a rules-based order and advances security, prosperity, and human dignity across the region. For instance, the Budget provides the necessary resources to implement the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) \u2014 a historic, high-standard trade agreement with 11 countries of the region that levels the playing field for American workers and American businesses.\n\nGrowing Partnerships in Africa. The Budget provides funding to ensure United States will uphold the commitments it made during the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in 2014, including with respect to Power Africa, Trade Africa, the Security Governance Initiative (SGI), the Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI), the African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership (APRRP), and the Early Warning and Response Partnership (EWARP). It also provides resources for implementing the peace agreement in South Sudan.\n\nPreparing for the Future. In addition to addressing today\u2019s changing security environment, the Budget makes sig\u00adnificant investments to maintain our military\u2019s superiority and ensure the United States always has an operational advantage over any potential adversary. The Budget does this by driving smart and essential innovation: pursuing new research and technology development; supporting updates and refinements to operational concepts and warfighting strategies; supporting capaci\u00adty building among local partners; building the Force of the Future; and pursuing additional enterprise reform.\n\nSustaining the President\u2019s Development and Democracy Agenda. The Budget continues to advance the Administration\u2019s development and democracy initiatives and activities as it seeks to reduce extreme poverty, encourage broad-based economic growth, and support democratic governance and human rights \u2013 and to drive progress toward meeting the global development vision and priorities adopted in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This includes investments in Feed the Future, the President\u2019s food security initiative; development programs that mobilize the private sector to deliver tangible results and advance U.S. interests; food aid and other humanitarian assistance programs; the First Lady\u2019s Let Girls Learn Initiative; and effective global health programs, including for the President\u2019s Malaria Initiative and the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).\n\nHonoring Our Commitment to Veterans. The Budget ensures continued investment in the five pillars the President has outlined for supporting the Nation\u2019s veterans: providing the resources and funding they deserve; ensuring high-quality and timely health care; getting veterans their earned benefits quickly and efficiently; ending veteran homelessness; and helping veterans and their families get good jobs, an education, and access to affordable housing. It also puts forward a proposal to fundamentally reform the broken appeals process for disability claims so that it can best serve our veterans.\n\nA GOVERNMENT OF THE FUTURE\n\nThe President is committed to driving last\u00ading change in how Government works \u2013 change that makes a significant, tangible, and positive difference in the economy and the lives of the American people. Over the past seven years, the Administration has launched successful efforts to modernize and improve citizen-facing services, eliminate wasteful spending, reduce the Federal real property footprint, improve the use of evidence to improve program performance, and spur innova\u00adtion in the private sector by opening to the public tens of thousands of Federal data sets and inno\u00advation assets at the national labs.\n\nSupporting the President\u2019s Management Agenda. The Budget includes investments to continue driving the President\u2019s Management Agenda by improving the service we provide to the American public; leveraging the Federal Government\u2019s buying power to bring more value and efficiency to how we use taxpayer dollars; opening Government data and research to the private sector to drive innovation and economic growth; promoting smarter information technology; modernizing permitting and environmental review processes; creating new Idea Labs to support employees with promising ideas; and, attracting and retaining the best talent in the Federal workforce.\n\nSupporting Digital Service Delivery for Citizens. In 2014 the Administration piloted the U.S. Digital Service, a unit of innovators, entrepreneurs, and engineers. This team of America\u2019s best digital experts has worked in collaboration with Federal agencies to implement streamlined and effective digital technology practices on the Nation\u2019s highest priority programs. This work includes collaborating with the Department of Education to launch the new College Scorecard to give stu\u00addents, parents, and their advisors most reliable national data to help with college choice and supporting the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) transition to launch the new myUSCIS which makes it easier for users to access information about the immigration process and immigration ser\u00advices. To institutionalize the dramatic improve\u00adments that this approach has demonstrated, the Budget supports the Administration\u2019s aggressive goal of hiring and placing 500 top technology and design experts to serve in the Government by January 2017.\n\nStrengthening Federal Cybersecurity. As outlined above, the Budget provides $19 billion in resources for cybersecurity. This includes the creation of a new $3.1 billion revolving fund, the Information Technology Modernization Fund (ITMF), to retire the Government\u2019s antiquated IT systems and transition to more secure and efficient modern IT systems, funding to streamline governance and secure Federal networks, and investments to strengthen the cybersecurity workforce and cybersecurity education across society.\n\nBuilding Evidence and Encouraging Innovation. The President has made it clear that policy decisions should be driven by evidence so that the Federal government can do more of what works and less of what does not. The Administration's evidence-based approaches have resulted in important gains in areas ranging from reducing veteran homelessness, to improving educational outcomes, to enhancing the effectiveness of international development programs. The Budget invests in expanding evidence-based approaches, developing and testing effective practices, and enhancing government\u2019s capacity to build and use evidence, in particular by expanding access to administrative data and further developing Federal, State, local, and tribal data infrastructure.\n\nReorganizing Government to Succeed in the Global Economy. The Budget also includes proposals to consolidate and reorganize Government agencies to make them leaner and more efficient, and it increases the use of evidence and evaluation to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely on programs that work.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/browserconfig.xml", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "application-name": "Whitehouse", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"creator": "@WhiteHouse", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/09/fact-sheet-presidents-fiscal-year-2017-budget-overview", "image": {"width": 240, "src": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/twitter_cards_default.jpg", "height": 240}, "title": "FACT SHEET: The President\u2019s Fiscal Year 2017 Budget: Overview", "site": "@WhiteHouse", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#003C80", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"site_name": "whitehouse.gov", "title": "FACT SHEET: The President\u2019s Fiscal Year 2017 Budget: Overview", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/09/fact-sheet-presidents-fiscal-year-2017-budget-overview", "image": {"width": 240, "secure_url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/twitter_cards_default.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "identifier": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/twitter_cards_default.jpg", "height": 240}, "updated_time": "2016-02-09T11:22:18-05:00", "type": "article"}, "MobileOptimized": "width", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-09T11:09:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-09T11:22:18-05:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "It also drives down deficits and maintains our fiscal progress through smart savings from health care, immigration, and tax reforms.\nBUILDING ON OUR ECONOMIC AND FISCAL PROGRESSThe Budget makes critical investments while adhering to the bipartisan budget agreement signed into law last fall.\nInvesting in Health Professions Education to Improve Access to Health Care Providers and Services.\nThe President\u2019s Budget continues that approach, investing in America\u2019s future and laying out a path to address our greatest challenges.\nThe Budget includes roughly $375 billion of health savings that grow over time and builds on the ACA with further incentives to improve qual\u00adity and control health care cost growth."}
