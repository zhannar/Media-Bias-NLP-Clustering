They arrested one 19-year-old Moroccan man on Saturday evening.\n\nIn Cologne, where a 100-strong force of officers continued their investigations, around 40 percent of the complaints included sexual offences, including two rapes.\n\nDWINDLING TRUST\n\nThe attacks, which prompted violent far-right protests on Saturday, threatens to further erode confidence in Merkel, and could stoke support for the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party ahead of three key state elections in March.\n\nMerkel's popularity has dwindled as she refused to place a limit on the influx of refugees.\n\nA survey sponsored by state broadcaster ARD showed that while 75 percent of those asked were very happy with Merkel's work in April last year, only 58 percent were pleased now.\n\nAlmost three quarters of those polled said migration was the most important issue for the government to deal with in 2016.\n\nThe Cologne attacks also heated up the debate on immigration in neighboring Austria.\n\n\"What happened in Cologne is unbelievable and unacceptable,\" Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner, a member of the conservative People's Party that is junior coalition partner to the Social Democrats, told newspaper Oesterreich.\n\nThere had been a handful of similar incidents in the border city of Salzburg. \"Such offenders should be deported,\" she said, backing a similar suggestion by Merkel.\n\nSwiss media contained numerous stories about sexual assaults on women by foreigners, fuelling tensions ahead of a referendum next month that would trigger the automatic deportation of foreigners convicted of some crimes.\n\nIn Germany, on Monday, a regional parliamentary commission will quiz police and others about the events on New Year's Eve in Cologne.\n\nThe anti-Islam PEGIDA, whose supporters threw bottles and fire crackers at a march in Cologne on Saturday before being dispersed by riot police, will later hold a rally in the eastern German city of Leipzig.\n\nThe far-right will likely seize on reports that the Paris attacker, who was shot last week as he wielded a meat cleaver and shouted \"Allahu akbar\" (God is Greatest), was known to police for drug dealing and harassing women.\n\nHe had an apartment in an accommodation center for asylum seekers in Recklinghausen, north of Cologne, where he had painted the symbol of Islamic state on the wall of two rooms.\n\n(Additional reporting by Ralf Bode in Berlin and Michael Shields in Zurich; Editing by Ros Russell)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Attacks on women in Cologne and other German cities on New Year'", "title": "Growing scale of Cologne attacks stokes German debate on migrants", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/10/Growing-scale-Cologne-attacks-stokes-German-debate-migrants", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/germany-assaults_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/10/Growing-scale-Cologne-attacks-stokes-German-debate-migrants", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/germany-assaults_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Attacks on women in Cologne and other German cities on New Year'", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The Cologne attacks also heated up the debate on immigration in neighboring Austria.\nThe investigation in Cologne is focused largely on asylum seekers or illegal migrants from north Africa, police said.\nIn Cologne, where a 100-strong force of officers continued their investigations, around 40 percent of the complaints included sexual offences, including two rapes.\nIn Germany, on Monday, a regional parliamentary commission will quiz police and others about the events on New Year's Eve in Cologne.\nThe attacks, mostly targeting women and ranging from theft to sexual molestation, have prompted a highly-charged debate in Germany about its welcoming stance for refugees and migrants, more than one million of whom arrived last year."}
