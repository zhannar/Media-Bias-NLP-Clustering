(Reuters) - Wall Street was lower on Friday after a slew of disappointing earnings reports from Microsoft and other major companies eclipsed a surge in oil prices which boosted energy shares.

Microsoft was the biggest drag on all three major indexes.

With oil hovering near five-month highs and recent economic data indicating a sluggish pace of economic growth globally, earnings have become a major swing factor for stocks.

The S&P 500 has staged a recovery from a steep selloff earlier this year and is inching toward its all-time high, helped also by a cautious Federal Reserve and companies beating tempered estimates. The index is up half a percent for the week.

"Investors are looking for clarity on two major catalysts - earnings season and the Fed," said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York.

"It's normal for the market to pause before a major level of resistance like 2,134, move sideways for a few days, even a few weeks and then blast off again," he said.

At 10:59 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 69.21 points, or 0.38 percent, at 17,913.31, the S&P 500 was down 9.51 points, or 0.45 percent, at 2,081.97 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 71.34 points, or 1.44 percent, at 4,874.55.

Six of the 10 major S&P sectors were lower. The technology sector was down 2.2 percent while energy was up 1 percent.

Alphabet and Microsoft were down 5.9 and 7.5 percent, respectively, after both missed profit and revenue estimates.

S&P 500 companies are seen posting a 7.2 percent fall in first-quarter profit, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, and shares of companies failing to beat the already lowered expectations are getting hammered.

General Electric was off 1.5 percent at $30.52 after it reported lower organic revenue.

Caterpillar shares were down 1.6 percent at $77.39 after its results.

Starbucks slipped 5.4 percent after missing sales expectations, while Visa was down 3.8 percent after it cut full-year revenue forecast.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,855 to 964. On the Nasdaq, 1,423 issues rose and 1,143 fell.

The S&P 500 index showed eight new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 27 new highs and 14 lows.
