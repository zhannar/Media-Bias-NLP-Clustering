Obama needs a speech that rallies the faithful without losing credibility with the rest. Searching for an ACA shout-out

This time, President Barack Obama is going to have to actually talk about Obamacare in his State of the Union address.

No more touch-the-base-and-keep-running treatments, the way he’s handled it the past couple of years. This time, he’ll be expected to linger on base a bit, at least long enough to acknowledge the launch of the biggest domestic achievement of his presidency — and do it in the least awkward way possible.

That’s the consensus of Democratic strategists, health care experts, pollsters and crisis-management experts, all of whom will have reasons to listen closely when Obama brings up the health care law on Jan. 28. It will be Obama’s most high-profile address since the clunky rollout began, and although it has come a long way since the worst days of October, it’s still not enough for him to say, “Nailed it.”

Instead, Obama will have to find an uplifting message about the law that doesn’t imply that everything’s suddenly back on track. The most he can say, based on the latest developments, is that “it’s moving back toward the track,” said Len Nichols, director of the Center for Health Policy Research and Ethics at George Mason University.

The federal enrollment website, HealthCare.gov, is working much better than it was in October, and sign-ups for private health coverage sped up dramatically in December. Now 3 million Americans have selected private health insurance plans, and there’s time for one more wave before enrollment ends March 31. And CGI, the main contractor on the botched website, has been shown the door.

That doesn’t mean the Obama administration can put its fire extinguishers away though. The age mix isn’t right yet with too many older adults and not enough younger ones. The early sign-ups in the exchanges may not include a lot of actual uninsured people, although some have probably been added through Medicaid. Insurers are still waiting for the “back end” of the website, the part that handles their payments, to be built.

And HealthCare.gov’s Facebook page is loaded with complaints about enrollment problems, like customers who say they couldn’t get any proof of coverage from their insurance companies, couldn’t get coverage for their kids or are bouncing back and forth between the website and insurance call centers to try to resolve errors.

The bottom line: Obama needs a speech that rallies the faithful without losing credibility with the rest of the country.

There’s actually a fairly easy formula, according to the strategists and health care analysts, and it doesn’t require a radical departure from what Obama has already said about the law. He needs to say that millions of people have already signed up for coverage — though he shouldn’t overstate how many. He should say that millions more who already have health coverage have gotten new benefits, like preventive care with no copayments. He has acknowledged the bad rollout, but tell the law’s most enthusiastic supporters that “we’ve turned the corner.”

Most of all, Democratic strategists say, he has to revive his message that “we’re not going back.”

“I don’t think he is going to try and resell that everything is perfect, but I would remind people that we can’t go back to a time when insurance companies were running the health care system and deciding who gets to participate,” said Democratic pollster John Anzalone. “No more getting denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions, no more being priced out of the marketplace because of DNA (pre-existing conditions), no more lifetime limits, no more having to file bankruptcy because a family has a medical emergency.”

Obama has said all of that before, but now that people are actually getting health coverage and other benefits, Democrats say the reminder is more important than ever.

“Americans do not like having their rights taken away. And they do not like the idea of the GOP taking away their newfound health care rights,” said Paul Begala, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton.

Health care didn’t occupy a lot of time in Obama’s last three State of the Union addresses since the law was signed. In 2011, Obama acknowledged that the new House Republican majority hated the law, said it can always be improved but vowed never to go back to the days when insurance companies could turn people down because of pre-existing conditions. In 2012 and 2013, Obamacare was reduced to a walk-on role — a couple of quick sentences, and that was it.
