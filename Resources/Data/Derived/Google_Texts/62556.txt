Sioux Falls, SD

It's been a wet weekend in western South Dakota.

Heavy rain on Sunday caused many creeks and rivers to overflow their banks in Rapid City and western South Dakota.

Midland which is located in Haakon County received over four and a half inches of rain. Mount Rushmore was close to three inches with Deerfield and Piedmont around two and a half.



Both the northern and southern Hills picked up at least two and a half inches over the weekend. Reports out of Rapid City are anywhere from an inch and a quarter to an inch and a half.

Remember, these rains fell on the saturated ground from snow earlier this month, so it's easy to see why flooding occurred. The short range forecast isn't looking any better as another half to full inch can fall through the week.
