Contrary to media predictions (including mine), it didn’t take weeks. On Tuesday, incumbent Democrat Sen. Mark Begich officially lost to his GOP challenger Dan Sullivan, giving Republicans their eighth Senate pickup in the 2014 midterms.

Begich had a lot of factors working against him in the Last Frontier. Alaskans were not happy with President Obama and therefore not impressed with Begich’s tendency to vote with him.

Begich’s gaffes also didn’t help. He managed to offend a female Republican Senator with sexist comments and then offered this lie during a debate with Sullivan.

The GOP has one more chance to extend their lead in the Senate in the Louisiana Senate runoff election on December 6, where Bill Cassidy is expected to beat Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-LA).

With the GOP making electoral history and Democrat favorability tanking to record lows, Republicans will have more than a few things to be thankful for on Turkey Day.
