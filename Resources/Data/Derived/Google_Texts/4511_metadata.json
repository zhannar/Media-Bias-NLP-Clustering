Employees get free spiritual counseling. But they do not get free insurance coverage for some contraceptives, even though President Obama\u2019s health care law requires it.\n\nHobby Lobby, a corporation, says that forcing it to provide the coverage would violate its religious beliefs. A federal appeals court agreed, and the Supreme Court is set to decide on Tuesday whether it will hear the Obama administration\u2019s appeal from that decision or appeals from one of several related cases.\n\nLegal experts say the court is all but certain to step in, setting the stage for another major decision on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act two years after a closely divided court sustained its requirement that most Americans obtain health insurance or pay a penalty.\n\n\u201cThe stakes here, symbolically and politically, are very high,\u201d said Douglas Laycock, a law professor at the University of Virginia, citing the clash between religious teachings and the administration\u2019s embattled health care law.\n\nIn weighing those interests, the Supreme Court would have to assess the limits of a principle recognized in its 2010 decision in Citizens United, which said corporations have free speech rights under the First Amendment. The question now is whether corporations also have the right to religious liberty.\n\nIn ruling for Hobby Lobby, the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit said it had applied \u201cthe First Amendment logic of Citizens United.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe see no reason the Supreme Court would recognize constitutional protection for a corporation\u2019s political expression but not its religious expression,\u201d Judge Timothy M. Tymkovich wrote for the majority.\n\nA dissenting member of the court, Chief Judge Mary Beck Briscoe, wrote that the majority\u2019s approach was \u201cnothing short of a radical revision of First Amendment law.\u201d\n\nBut Judge Harris L Hartz, in a concurrence, said the case was in some ways easier than Citizens United. \u201cA corporation exercising religious beliefs is not corrupting anyone,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAmong Hobby Lobby\u2019s lawyers is Paul D. Clement, who led the 2012 Supreme Court challenge to the health care law. The new case opened another front in a larger war on the law, which, as Hobby Lobby put it in its Supreme Court brief, \u201cimposes massive obligations on individuals and corporations alike in the process of attempting to fundamentally reorder the nation\u2019s health care system.\u201d\n\nMr. Clement\u2019s main adversary in the 2012 case, Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr., told the justices that the 10th Circuit\u2019s \u201cunprecedented ruling\u201d in this case would allow \u201cfor-profit corporations to deny employees the health coverage to which they are otherwise entitled by federal law, based on the religious objections of the individuals who own a controlling stake in the corporations.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court is generally receptive to appeals from the solicitor general, especially when a lower court has effectively held a federal law unconstitutional. The justices are also apt to step in when, as here, lower courts are divided on an important legal question. Even Hobby Lobby, which won in the appeals court, agrees that the justices should hear the administration\u2019s appeal.\n\n\u201cThis is a perfect storm,\u201d said Richard Garnett, a law professor at Notre Dame, adding that it is also a worrisome one. \u201cDebates about campaign finance in Citizens United and abortion and Obamacare,\u201d he said, \u201ccould distort the court\u2019s analysis of religious freedom.\u201d\n\nHobby Lobby was founded in 1970 in Oklahoma City by David Green, and it now has more than 500 stores and 13,000 employees of all sorts of faiths. Mr. Green and his family own Hobby Lobby through a privately held corporation.\n\nThe Greens told the justices in their brief that some drugs and devices that can prevent embryos from implanting in the womb are tantamount to abortion and that providing insurance coverage for those forms of contraception would make the company and its owners complicit in the practice. They said they had no objection to 16 other forms of contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration, including condoms, diaphragms, sponges, several kinds of birth control pills and sterilization surgery.\n\nBut Hobby Lobby\u2019s failure to offer comprehensive coverage could, it said, subject it to federal fines of $1.3 million a day. Dropping insurance coverage for its employees, it added, would be disruptive and unfair and lead to fines of $26 million a year.\n\nMr. Verrilli countered that requiring insurance plans to include comprehensive coverage for contraception was justified by the government\u2019s interest in \u201cthe promotion of public health\u201d and in ensuring that \u201cwomen have equal access to health care services.\u201d Doctors rather than employers should decide which form of contraception is best, he added.\n\nThe administration has excluded many religious organizations from the law\u2019s requirements; it has grandfathered some insurance plans that had not previously offered the coverage; and, under the health care law, small employers need not offer health coverage at all. In June, a federal judge in Tampa, Fla., estimated that a third of Americans are not subject to the requirement that their employers provide coverage for contraceptives.\n\nBut the administration drew a line at larger, for-profit, secular corporations.\n\n\u201cCongress has granted religious organizations alone the latitude to discriminate on the basis of religion in setting the terms and conditions of employment, including compensation,\u201d the Justice Department told the 10th Circuit appeals court, in Denver.\n\n\u201cNo court has ever found a for-profit company to be a religious organization for purposes of federal law,\u201d the brief went on. \u201cTo the contrary, courts have emphasized that an entity\u2019s for-profit status is an objective criterion that allows courts to distinguish a secular company from a potentially religious organization, without conducting an intrusive inquiry into the entity\u2019s religious beliefs.\u201d\n\nThe appeals court disagreed, ruling that Hobby Lobby is a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of the relevant federal law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.\n\nReligious liberty, Judge Tymkovich wrote, cannot turn on whether money changes hands. \u201cWould an incorporated kosher butcher really have no claim to challenge a regulation mandating non-kosher butchering practices?\u201d he asked.\n\nOther federal appeals courts considering challenges to the health care law\u2019s so-called contraception mandate have ruled that the 1993 law does not apply to corporations.\n\nAfter finding that Hobby Lobby was entitled to the law\u2019s protections, the 10th Circuit went on to say that the company\u2019s sincere religious beliefs had been compromised without good reason, noting the limited number of contraception methods at issue and the many employers exempt from the law\u2019s requirements.\n\nProfessor Laycock said that only one thing was certain about the issues presented in the case, Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores, No. 13-354.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re almost sure to take it,\u201d he said of the justices, \u201cand no one has any idea how it\u2019s going to come out.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131124212634, "twitter": {"description": "The Supreme Court will decide whether to hear an Obama administration appeal of a lower court\u2019s ruling that a company could restrict contraception insurance coverage.", "title": "Court Confronts Religious Rights of Corporations", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/25/us/court-confronts-religious-rights-of-corporations.html?pagewanted=all", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/25/us/jp-SCOTUS-1/jp-SCOTUS-1-thumbLarge.jpg", "creator": "@adamliptak", "site": "@nytimes", "card": "summary"}, "xlarge": "images/2013/11/25/us/jp-SCOTUS-1/jp-SCOTUS-1-articleLarge.jpg", "thumbnail_width": 75, "hdl_p": "Court Confronts Religious Rights of Corporations", "sectionfront_jsonp": "http://json8.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "November 24, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Citizens United v Federal Election Commission (Supreme Court Decision),Freedom of Religion,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Birth Control and Family Planning,Hobby Lobby,Supreme Court (US)", "xlarge_height": 397, "news_keywords": "Citizens United v.
