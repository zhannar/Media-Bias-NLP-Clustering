Q: After I have had a glass of wine, my face heats up and turns bright red. This also happens to my siblings. What is going on?

A: Bright red skin after drinking, caused by dilated capillaries, is almost certainly an example of the alcohol flush reaction, related to the incomplete metabolism of alcohol. The condition is often genetic and is especially common in people of Chinese, Japanese and Korean descent.

Recent research on the genetically coded enzyme deficiency involved in the reaction has linked it to a higher risk of esophageal cancer in East Asians.

When alcohol is ingested, it is first metabolized primarily by an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase, or ADH. The resulting chemical, acetaldehyde, is a carcinogen. The next step in metabolism is normally for the acetaldehyde to be metabolized to acetate, chiefly by the enzyme ALDH2.

If the drinker’s body makes that enzyme in a faulty variety, however, its action is weak or absent, and acetaldehyde builds up in the body. This leads to the flushing reaction, as well as nausea and rapid heartbeat.

Those who get the gene for the faulty enzyme from both parents have reactions so severe that it limits drinking and actually protects against the greater cancer risk. Inheriting one faulty gene means a milder flushing reaction, which allows drinking and has been linked to a much higher risk of esophageal cancer among even moderate drinkers.
