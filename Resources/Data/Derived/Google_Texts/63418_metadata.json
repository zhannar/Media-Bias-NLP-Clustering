One e-card reads, \u201cAs a reward for signing up for health insurance, I\u2019ll defriend you on Facebook.\u201d Another group, Organizing for Action, is seeking to steer holiday conversations toward health care by encouraging parents to have \u201cthe talk\u201d with their adult children. And a Colorado group is promoting an ad featuring a hapless young man who calls his mother from the golf course: \u201cYo, Mom, do I got insurance?\u201d\n\nRecruiting enough young people is a major goal of the Obama administration because insurers need healthy customers to offset the cost of caring for those with expensive medical needs.\n\nThe goal carries even more urgency now that insurers are considering a proposal by President Obama to let people, many of them healthy, stay on their existing policies for another year. If fewer of those people buy insurance in the new marketplaces, signing up young people without insurance will be even more crucial. Young people also account for a major chunk of the uninsured. About 40 percent of the estimated 41 million uninsured people nationwide who are eligible for coverage are between the ages of 18 and 35, according to the administration.\n\nEven as supporters are enlisting mothers in the effort to sign up their adult children, critics have mounted an equally aggressive and well-funded campaign urging young people to \u201copt out\u201d of coverage. Opponents use many of the same marketing tools as the law\u2019s supporters, reaching out to young people on social media and through web videos.\n\nAdvocacy groups and insurers are expected to make a major marketing push beginning in early December, when the Obama administration has said it expects the malfunctioning federal health care website to be working better. They have their targets set on two major deadlines: Dec. 23, when insurance must be purchased for coverage beginning on Jan. 1, and March 31, when the open enrollment period will end.\n\nBeneath the marketing campaigns\u2019 playful language is a deeper truth: When it comes to making major life decisions, many people \u2014 especially young adults \u2014 still turn to their mothers for help. More broadly, women make about 80 percent of the health care decisions for their families, according to the federal Labor Department.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the cutest phenomenon ever,\u201d said Lynn Quincy, a senior health policy analyst at Consumers Union, who stumbled on the significance of mothers while conducting a focus group of men and women last year about how well people understood the language in their insurance policies. When asked who they turned to for advice about health care, the overwhelming answer was their mothers. \u201cThese people could have husbands, they could have fathers, they may have a nurse who lives next door, but they\u2019re all going to their moms,\u201d she said.\n\nOf course, the administration and advocacy groups are also reaching out directly to young people themselves, collaborating with outlets like the comedy website Funny or Die, initiating social media campaigns, handing out fliers at concerts and sponsoring a video contest aimed at getting young people to sign up.\n\n\u201cPeople need to have heard about it a couple of times, and frankly from a couple of different sources,\u201d said Jon Carson, the executive director of Organizing for Action, the nonprofit group that grew out of President Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign organization. He said mothers represented just one avenue that they hoped would help persuade a young person to enroll. The recently posted video is part of a campaign, called Healthcare for the Holidays, that seeks to arm parents with talking points when they see their children at family get-togethers.\n\nThis approach may resonate especially well with the so-called millennial generation, which came of age in a recession and may still financially depend on their parents, say some experts.\n\n\u201cMillennials love their parents and they count on them for advice,\u201d said Morley Winograd, the co-author of three books on the millennial generation. He noted that this might sound surprising to baby boomers, who famously rebelled against their parents\u2019 generation. But millennials \u201cassume that their parents have more worldly experience, and know about things like money and health insurance,\u201d he said.\n\nMary Babich, the mother of two children in their 20s without insurance, said she had been pestering both of them to sign up. \u201cThey look at it as just government bureaucracy \u2014 as almost akin to filling out their taxes,\u201d said Ms. Babich, who lives in Wisconsin. She paused, and added, \u201cThe sad thing is, I\u2019ve always done both of their taxes.\u201d\n\nThe mother-knows-best strategy isn\u2019t entirely new. In 2007, when Massachusetts introduced its health care law, officials mailed greeting cards, timed for Mother\u2019s Day, to the parents of young men between the ages of 18 and 26. Market research had shown this group was among the most resistant to buying insurance. \u201cThe idea was to trigger a phone call from the parent to the child to say, \u2018Hey, by the way, do you have insurance?\u2019 \u201d said Kevin J. Counihan, who served as chief marketing officer for Massachusetts\u2019s health insurance marketplace at the time. \u201cWe made the hypothesis that we could best reach the young men through their mothers.\u201d\n\nThe effort, Mr. Counihan said, was a moderate success: Many parents decided to pick up the bill for their sons\u2019 health insurance. And more often than not, \u201cwe found they bought the most expensive plan because apparently nothing was too good for Johnny.\u201d Mr. Counihan is now chief executive of Connecticut\u2019s state marketplace and said he was still targeting the mothers of young men by focusing on churches and community groups where they are likely to be members.\n\nInsurers are also taking note of this influence. Shaun Greene, the chief operating officer at Arches Health Plan, a health care co-op in Utah, said he was surprised during a recent televised call-in when he fielded several calls from parents who quickly handed the phone to their children. \u201cAt least three of them had their kid by the ear,\u201d he said, explaining: \u201cMy son or daughter needs insurance. Talk to them.\u201d\n\nA certain level of concern is just part of being a parent, said Nicole Duritz, who helped develop the AARP campaign. \u201cI\u2019m a mom and I\u2019m constantly worried about my kids, and making sure they\u2019re making good decisions,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd health insurance falls into that category.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s certainly true for Lynne Jackier, of Ithaca, N.Y., who has been helping her 24-year-old daughter look into buying health insurance on the state marketplace. She also has a 26-year-old son who recently moved to California and is also uninsured.\n\n\u201cI feel like, as parents, it\u2019s our responsibility to get them to look at this now,\u201d Ms. Jackier said.\n\nHer daughter, Rosie Simon, works as a nanny in Westchester County and said she had been uninsured since graduating from college a few years ago. Although Ms. Simon said that she had heard about the changes coming under the health care law, she added that her mother had been persistent in making sure she signed up. Last weekend, during a visit home, the two sat down at the computer and took the initial steps of completing an application on New York\u2019s marketplace.\n\nWithout insurance, Ms. Simon said she often delayed going to the doctor when sick, or leaned on her parents for help. Ms. Jackier, who is on Medicaid and so can\u2019t cover her daughter through private insurance, said she had become accustomed to the frustrating conversations. \u201cShe\u2019ll get sick and I\u2019ll say, \u2018You have go to the doctor,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Jackier said. \u201cAnd she\u2019ll say, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t have insurance.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe family had a scare when Ms. Simon recently developed a serious kidney infection. Her parents paid the bill, which cost a few hundred dollars. It wasn\u2019t ideal, Ms. Simon said, but \u201cI\u2019m still their baby.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131125221443, "twitter": {"description": "To encourage enrollment by the young Americans who are crucial to the success of the Affordable Care Act, insurers are appealing to their primary health care advisers: their mothers.", "title": "New Pitch for Health Initiative: Mind Your Mom.
