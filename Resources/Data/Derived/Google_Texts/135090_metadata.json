It has exceeded 80 percent since then, according to the Louisiana Department of Revenue.\n\nFor a graphic showing how corporate tax exemptions soared as state revenue fell, see http://tmsnrt.rs/1T7qbm9\n\nPlummeting oil prices dealt the latest blow to state revenues. Deficits are projected at $940 million for the fiscal year ending June 30 and about $2 billion for next year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotten pretty bad, pretty rapidly,\u201d said the state legislature's chief economist, Greg Albrecht, who believes Louisiana is heading into a recession.\n\nJindal has kept a low profile since leaving office in January and could not be reached for comment. In a January speech, he highlighted efforts to cut government and stimulate the economy without raising taxes.\n\n\"You look at the projects \u2014 the employers coming in and those who are expanding \u2014 we\u2019ve seen tremendous progress,\" he said.\n\nRISING STAR\n\nIn 2008, when Jindal became governor at 36, he was a rising GOP star, often mentioned as a potential presidential candidate. He cultivated that image, staking his political fortunes on a platform of slashing taxes, dismantling big government and attracting business.\n\nThe next year, Jindal helped push through legislation to cut personal income taxes and worked to enhance Louisiana's already robust corporate tax breaks.\n\nIn July of 2009, he signed bills that created or expanded nine tax credits to sectors including film, port cargo and infrastructure. The credits are typically worth 20 to 40 percent of a company's in-state spending, or in some cases spending on payroll or research.\n\nIn all, annual corporate tax exemptions rose during Jindal's term by about $1 billion, to $1.96 billion in 2014, according to state data.\n\nHis tax-cutting hit a wall in 2013 when he failed to convince a Republican-controlled legislature to abolish personal and business income taxes.\n\n\"He really wanted to go to a national stage, run for president, and say he repealed the personal income tax,\" said Robert Travis Scott, president of the Public Affairs Research Council, a nonpartisan organization.\n\nMany of Jindal's political successes had consequences for Louisiana's budget. A state-commissioned study found that film tax credits, for example, cost the state an estimated $171 million in 2014.\n\n\u201cThe state ends up with the short end of the stick,\u201d said Loren Scott, author of the study, which also found some economic benefits.\n\nAmong the biggest beneficiaries of Louisiana subsidies is the petrochemical industry. One massive project under construction in Southwestern Louisiana - Sempra Energy's $6 billion liquefied natural gas processing complex and export terminal - will receive a $2.2 billion property tax break over a decade, records show.\n\nThe plant will create 130 permanent jobs with average salaries of $80,000, records show. The California-based company also got rebates on some payroll costs and a capital investment tax credit.\n\nLouisiana's subsidies are getting more scrutiny in the budget crisis. Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards, who took office in January, has proposed cutting incentives but faces resistance from Republican legislators and business groups.\n\n\u201cThe previous administration,\" Edwards said, \"blew a hole in our state budget by writing checks for tax credits, rebates, or refunds to corporations with no consideration of whether Louisiana receives a good return on our investment.\u201d\n\nJindal advisor Curt Anderson said the subsidies resulted in new jobs and higher wages. \u201cHis decision to shrink the government and grow the private sector economy was purposeful.\"\n\nBusiness groups continue to support the incentives, saying they are invaluable to the state economy.\n\n\"In terms of economic development, Jindal was an outstanding governor,\" said Michael Hecht, president of Greater New Orleans Inc. \"Corporations are being scapegoated.\"\n\nFalling oil prices and personal income tax cuts also played major roles in the crisis, according to state data. Oil-related revenues are projected to drop by nearly $400 million this fiscal year, the data shows. Personal income tax breaks pushed by Jindal and predecessor, Democrat Kathleen Blanco, reduced revenues by about $800 million annually, said Albrecht, the state economist.\n\nMost Louisiana business subsidy programs preceded the Jindal administration, but their use and cost shot up during his tenure, said Jan Moller, director of the nonpartisan Louisiana Budget Project. The governor, he said, directed state economic development officials to \"aggressively pursue companies and give them as many incentives as possible.\"\n\nCRISIS MANAGEMENT\n\nAs Louisiana faced mounting shortfalls, Jindal sought solutions that didn't involve raising taxes.\n\n\u201cDespite the fact that the state was hemorrhaging money, he just wanted to keep his tax virginity\u201d for his presidential campaign, said Edward Chervenak, a political science professor at the University of New Orleans, echoing a theme common among Democrats and Republicans alike in the state.\n\nHaving signed a pledge not to raise taxes, Jindal turned to one-time fixes, such as offering tax amnesty to delinquent taxpayers and raiding state trust funds. That included drawing down $520 million from the Medicaid Trust Fund for the Elderly and $540 million from a reserve fund for state employee healthcare, according to Republican state Treasurer John Kennedy.\n\nJindal failed last year to sell the state's tobacco settlement, worth $1.2 billion over time, for an upfront lump sum of $750 million - a move Kennedy compared to \"a junkie selling his TV or smartphone to buy another fix.\"\n\nLawmakers now face tough choices. Healthcare and education budgets - particularly colleges - already have been slashed and could see more cuts. And legislators are considering raising sales taxes by up to 2 cents.\n\nState Representative Julie Stokes, a Republican from the New Orleans suburb of Kenner, said her GOP colleagues have been reluctant to raise taxes, and she understands.\n\n\"Look, I don\u2019t want to talk about it - I\u2019m a conservative Republican from a conservative Republican district,\" she said. \"But I just feel like we\u2019ve got to lose the talking points and have an honest dialogue.\u201d\n\n(Editing by Sue Horton and Lisa Girion)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "(Reuters) - Near the end of his eight years as Louisiana governor, Bobby Jindal, a tax", "title": "After Jindal, Louisiana reels from corporate tax giveaways", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/08/After-Jindal-Louisiana-reels-corporate-tax-giveaways", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/louisiana-budget-politics_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/08/After-Jindal-Louisiana-reels-corporate-tax-giveaways", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/louisiana-budget-politics_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "(Reuters) - Near the end of his eight years as Louisiana governor, Bobby Jindal, a tax", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The next year, Jindal helped push through legislation to cut personal income taxes and worked to enhance Louisiana's already robust corporate tax breaks.\nBusiness tax subsidies peaked in 2012, when the state exempted 88 percent of corporate income taxes, or about $1.8 billion.\nFalling oil prices and personal income tax cuts also played major roles in the crisis, according to state data.\nPersonal income tax breaks pushed by Jindal and predecessor, Democrat Kathleen Blanco, reduced revenues by about $800 million annually, said Albrecht, the state economist.\nAmong the biggest beneficiaries of Louisiana subsidies is the petrochemical industry."}
