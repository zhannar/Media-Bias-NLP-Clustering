Earnings are seen at $1.879 per share.\n\n\u201cThe bar has been raised a bit on its earnings report from where it was a week ago. The price action is telling you there\u2019s more optimism built into it,\u201d said Michael James, managing director of equities trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.\n\nOptions market action shows traders expect Apple shares to move roughly 5.0 percent by the end of next week. The average move for the stock the day after its report in the last eight quarters was 4.4 percent, up or down.\n\n\u201cWill an above-estimates from Apple and raised guidance help? Sure it will. But we could still get there without that happening,\u201d said James of the possibility of the Nasdaq 100 hitting a record.\n\n\u201cThe power of the moves in some of these large cap tech stocks has been breathtaking,\u201d he said.\n\nChip makers were also among the top five percentage gainers in the Nasdaq 100 since the index closed at its 2015 low on Aug. 25, with SanDisk topping the list with a 70 percent jump on the back of a takeover bid from Western Digital.\n\nThe overwhelming leadership from established technology companies is a positive for this market move higher, according to Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.\n\n\u201cThe last time the Nasdaq 100 was the market leader a lot of it was speculative investments, but these (tech) companies actually return money to shareholders,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTech deserves the leadership; the stock market is rewarding growth.\u201d\n\nBiotech the flip side to tech stock leadership\n\nWhile technology stocks have led the market recovery, biotech stocks have been a drag on performance.\n\nThe Nasdaq Biotech Index is down 3.5 percent from its Aug. 25 close, and more than 20 percent below its year high. The three index components with the largest declines in market capitalization in the last eight weeks are Mylan, Illumina and Biogen.\n\n\u201cThere has been a major rotation out of healthcare and into tech and it has continued after the recent earnings reports,\u201d said Wedbush\u2019s James, referring to strong results from Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet.\n\nBiotech stocks were shaken in September when U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton first tweeted concerns about drug prices and the selling spread to other areas of the healthcare sector. Investors have been dumping shares of everything from hospitals to traditional pharmaceutical companies and insurers in recent weeks.\n\nSince peaking in July, the Nasdaq Biotech Index has fallen 23 percent, the broad S&P Health Care Index has lost 12 percent and the S&P 500 Health Care Facilities index is down 31 percent.\n\nFund managers now say they expect regulatory threats on drug prices, disappointing earnings, higher interest rates that could hurt heavily indebted hospitals, and the loss of the initial Obamacare boost to business to all weigh on health sector stocks this year.\n\n(Reporting by Rodrigo Campos; Editing by Clive McKeef)", "article_metadata": {"bt": {"pubDate": "2015-10-24T01:10:04+00:00", "author": "reuters", "modDate": "2015-10-24T01:10:04+00:00", "keywords": "apple,earnings,nasdaq", "type": "news", "id": 1827536}, "og": {"site_name": "VentureBeat", "description": "(By Rodrigo Campos, Reuters) - The Nasdaq 100 index, dominated by U.S. technology stocks, may set a record high next week, helped by good earnings from Apple Inc expected on Tuesday.", "title": "Apple\u2019s earnings next week may set a Nasdaq\u00a0record", "url": "http://venturebeat.com/2015/10/24/apples-earnings-next-week-may-set-a-nasdaq-record/", "image": "http://1u88jj3r4db2x4txp44yqfj1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/apple-store-5th-ave-ny-780x372.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "(By Rodrigo Campos, Reuters) \u2013 The Nasdaq 100 index, dominated by U.S. technology stocks, may set a record high next week, helped by good earnings from Apple Inc expected on Tuesday.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "(By Rodrigo Campos, Reuters) \u2013 The Nasdaq 100 index, dominated by U.S. technology stocks, may set a record high next week, helped by good earnings from Apple Inc expected on Tuesday.\nBut we could still get there without that happening,\u201d said James of the possibility of the Nasdaq 100 hitting a record.\nThe Nasdaq 100 index, including Apple, is just 1.5 percent below its year high and 4.0 percent from its record high back in March 2000.\n\u201cThe power of the moves in some of these large cap tech stocks has been breathtaking,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe bar has been raised a bit on its earnings report from where it was a week ago."}
