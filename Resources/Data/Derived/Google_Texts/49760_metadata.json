McNEIL Jr.\n\nThe New York Times\n\nThe idea came to Jorge Od\u00f3n as he slept. Somehow, he said, his unconscious made the leap from a YouTube video he had just seen on extracting a lost cork from a wine bottle to the realization that the same parlor trick could save a baby stuck in the birth canal.\n\nMr. Od\u00f3n, 59, an Argentine car mechanic, built his first prototype in his kitchen, using a glass jar for a womb, his daughter\u2019s doll for the trapped baby, and a fabric bag and sleeve sewn by his wife as his lifesaving device.\n\nUnlikely as it seems, the idea that took shape on his counter has won the enthusiastic endorsement of the World Health Organization and major donors, and an American medical technology company has just licensed it for production.\n\nWith the Od\u00f3n Device, an attendant slips a plastic bag inside a lubricated plastic sleeve around the head, inflates it to grip the head and pulls the bag until the baby emerges.\n\nDoctors say it has enormous potential to save babies in poor countries, and perhaps to reduce cesarean section births in rich ones.\n\n\u201cThis is very exciting,\u201d said Dr. Mario Merialdi, the W.H.O.\u2019s chief coordinator for improving maternal and perinatal health and an early champion of the Od\u00f3n Device. \u201cThis critical moment of life is one in which there\u2019s been very little advancement for years.\u201d\n\nAbout 10 percent of the 137 million births worldwide each year have potentially serious complications, Dr. Merialdi said. About 5.6 million babies are stillborn or die quickly, and about 260,000 women die in childbirth. Obstructed labor, which can occur when a baby\u2019s head is too large or an exhausted mother\u2019s contractions stop, is a major factor.\n\nIn wealthy countries, fetal distress results in a rush to the operating room. In poor, rural clinics, Dr. Merialdi said, \u201cif the baby doesn\u2019t come out, the woman is on her own.\u201d\n\nThe current options in those cases are forceps \u2014 large, rounded pliers \u2014 or suction cups attached to the baby\u2019s scalp. In untrained hands, either can cause hemorrhages, crush the baby\u2019s head or twist its spine.\n\nAlthough more testing is planned on the Od\u00f3n Device, doctors said it appeared to be safe for midwives with minimal training to use.\n\nAlong the way, it has won research grants from the United States Agency for International Development and from Grand Challenges Canada. \u201cWe\u2019ve given out $32 million for 61 different innovations, and this one is the farthest along,\u201d said Dr. Peter A. Singer, the chief executive of Grand Challenges Canada.\n\nThe device will be manufactured by Becton, Dickinson and Company, or BD, of Franklin Lakes, N.J., which is better known for making syringes.\n\n\u201cMy first reaction, as soon as I saw it, was positive,\u201d said Gary M. Cohen, the company\u2019s executive vice president for global health. It was at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that Dr. Merialdi asked him to consider taking it on.\n\n\u201cMany inventions get to the prototype stage, but that\u2019s maybe 15 percent of what needs to be done,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cThere\u2019s finalizing the design for manufacture, quality control, the regulatory work and clinical studies. Absent that, they don\u2019t see the light of day.\u201d\n\nSo far, the device has been safety-tested only on 30 Argentine women, all of whom were in hospitals, had given birth before and were in normal labor.\n\n\u201cI was glad they asked me, because it was for a good cause,\u201d said Luciana Valle, a kindergarten teacher who was 31 two years ago when her son, Matteo, was one of the first babies extracted with the device. Because Matteo weighed almost nine pounds, \u201cit really helped,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cHis head came out on my second push.\u201d\n\nThe W.H.O. will now oversee tests on 100 more women in normal labor in China, India and South Africa, and then on 170 women in obstructed labor.\n\nIn a telephone interview from Argentina, Mr. Od\u00f3n described the origins of his idea.\n\nHe tinkers at his garage, but his previous inventions were car parts. Seven years ago, he said, employees were imitating a video showing that a cork pushed into an empty bottle can be retrieved by inserting a plastic grocery bag, blowing until it surrounds the cork, and drawing it out.\n\nThat night, he won a dinner bet on it.\n\nAt 4 a.m., he woke his wife and told her the idea that had just come to him. (His own children were born without problems, he said, but he has an aunt who suffered nerve damage from birth.)\n\nHis wife, he recalled, \u201csaid I was crazy and went back to sleep.\u201d\n\nThe next morning, a somewhat skeptical friend introduced him to an obstetrician. \u201cYou can imagine these two guys in suits in a waiting room full of pregnant ladies,\u201d he said.\n\nThe doctor was encouraging, so he kept working. Polyethylene replaced the bag his wife had sewn, and the jar was replaced by a plastic uterus.\n\nWith the help of a cousin, Mr. Od\u00f3n met the chief of obstetrics at a major hospital in Buenos Aires. The chief had a friend at the W.H.O., who knew Dr. Merialdi, who, at a 2008 medical conference in Argentina, granted Mr. Od\u00f3n 10 minutes during a coffee break.\n\nThe meeting instead lasted two hours. At the end, Dr. Merialdi declared the idea \u201cfantastic\u201d and arranged for testing at the Des Moines University simulation lab, which has mannequins more true-to-life than a doll and a jar.\n\nSince then, Mr. Od\u00f3n has continued to refine the device, patenting each change so he will eventually earn royalties on it.\n\n\u201cMy daughter said, \u2018And now I can have my doll back,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nIt is too early to know what BD will charge, Mr. Cohen said, but each device should cost less than $50 to make. While the company expects to profit on all sales, it will charge poor countries less.\n\nDr. Merialdi said he endorsed a modest profit motive because he had seen other lifesaving ideas languish for lack of it. He cited magnesium sulfate injections, which can prevent fatal eclampsia, and corticosteroids, which speed lung development in premature infants.\n\n\u201cBut first, this problem needed someone like Jorge,\u201d he said. \u201cAn obstetrician would have tried to improve the forceps or the vacuum extractor, but obstructed labor needed a mechanic. And 10 years ago, this would not have been possible. Without YouTube, he never would have seen the video.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2013/11/jp-birth1-cropHF.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "Method to save baby stuck in birth canal borrows from wine-cork puller"}, "article_summary": "Dr. Merialdi said he endorsed a modest profit motive because he had seen other lifesaving ideas languish for lack of it.\nIt was at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that Dr. Merialdi asked him to consider taking it on.\nWith the help of a cousin, Mr. Od\u00f3n met the chief of obstetrics at a major hospital in Buenos Aires.\nAlthough more testing is planned on the Od\u00f3n Device, doctors said it appeared to be safe for midwives with minimal training to use.\n\u201cThis critical moment of life is one in which there\u2019s been very little advancement for years.\u201dAbout 10 percent of the 137 million births worldwide each year have potentially serious complications, Dr. Merialdi said."}
