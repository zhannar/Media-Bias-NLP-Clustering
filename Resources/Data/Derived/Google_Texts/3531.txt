This NYC Resistor-designed food system provides just about everything you'll need to grow produce indoors, including rotating shelves that'll assure that plants get the best light possible and an aeroponic spray mist that cuts down on water by 90-percent, eliminates the need for soil and delivers nutrients directly to the plant. All of the above is automated, using a network of sensors and info downloaded from the internet and culled from a network of experts. Check out a video of the stackable cubes after the break, and be sure to watch GrowCubess' presentation at Expand next month.
