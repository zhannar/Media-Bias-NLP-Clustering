During Saturday night’s ABC News Republican debate, The Independent Journal Review’s Larry O’Connor (a former Breitbart editor) asked the Republican candidate’s (via videotape) how they intended to beat the narrative around Hillary Clinton becoming the first woman president. “In 2008 we saw how motivated an electorate can be when they think their vote is making history … how will you change that narrative?”

Trump responded with the claim that he does “very, very well against her in the polls, and I can tell you I am the last person she wants to run against.” Trump continued by touching on the size of his crowds, the idea that his campaign is in fact a movement, and Clinton’s weak spots surrounding her growing email scandal:

I think you can see what we’ve done in terms of galvanizing [people]. I’ve been all over the country. Last night I was in South Carolina — we had 12,000 people. It set up in about 4 days. We’ve created a movement. A lot of it has to do, for example, the question on drugs. I’m the first one who said build a wall. But a real wall, not a toy wall like they have right now, and you’ll solve lots of problems. But we will galvanize the people of this country and we will beat Hillary Clinton because — assuming that she runs, by the way. How she gets away with the email stuff is hard to believe. So I don’t know that she’s gunna be running. But on the assumption she runs… But if she runs she’s gunna be able to run for one reason and that’s because the Democrats are protecting her. So many people have done so much less than her and their lives have been destroyed. But on the assumption they protect her, we will win the election handily.
