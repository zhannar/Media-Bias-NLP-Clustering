Marco Rubio said that \u201cover 40 percent of small and mid-size banks \u2026 have been wiped out\u201d since the Dodd-Frank law was passed. Actually, the total number of commercial banks has gone down only 16 percent, continuing a longtime trend.\n\nBusinessman Donald Trump said his net worth is $10 billion, but outside estimates put the figure much lower.\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush twice claimed that he cut taxes in the state by $19 billion. But that includes cuts in Florida estate taxes mandated by federal law that Bush had nothing to do with.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich claimed his state\u2019s Medicaid program \u201cis growing at one of the lowest rates in the country.\u201d Ohio ranks 16th in terms of enrollment growth post-Affordable Care Act among the 30 expansion states and Washington, D.C.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker claimed his state \u201cmore than made up\u201d for the job losses from the recession. That\u2019s a stretch. The state has gained 4,000 jobs since the start of the recession.\n\nRubio said he had never advocated exceptions for rape or incest to abortion bans, but he cosponsored a bill in 2013 that contained just such exceptions.\n\nBoasting about his education initiatives while governor, Bush claimed that the graduation rate \u201cimproved by 50 percent.\u201d But most of the increase happened after Bush left office; the rate increased about 13 percent when he was governor.\n\nBush claimed that the U.S. spends more per student than any other country, but Luxembourg, Switzerland and Norway all spend more for primary and secondary education.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee repeated the old claim that Obamacare \u201crobbed\u201d Medicare of $700 billion. That\u2019s a reduction in the future growth of spending over 10 years.\n\nWe fact-checked the earlier debate, too, for candidates not in the top 10. See our story, \u201cFactChecking the GOP Debate, Early Edition.\u201d\n\nAnalysis\n\nRubio on Dodd-Frank\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio implied that the new banking law imposed in 2010 was responsible for killing off small banks and loans to small business.\n\nRubio: [W]e need to repeal Dodd-Frank. It is eviscerating small businesses and small banks. Twenty \u2014 over 40 percent of small and mid-size banks that loan money to small businesses have been wiped out over the \u2014 since Dodd-Frank has passed.\n\nActually, the total number of commercial banks has gone down only 16 percent since the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law July 21, 2010. And that decline continues a trend that goes back at least to the 1980s.\n\nNote that Rubio caught himself. He started to say the decline was \u201cover the\u201d law \u2014 meaning the law caused the decline \u2014 but then said the decline happened \u201csince\u201d the law was passed. That just describes a coincidence, which may or may not have been caused by the law.\n\nThe fact is, small and medium-sized banks had been getting swallowed up by larger banks for decades before the Dodd-Frank bill was enacted. And the rate does not appear to have accelerated since the law took effect, as seen in this graph from the Federal Reserve Economic Data database, maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\n\nThe numbers on which the graphic is based show that there were 14,400 commercial banks (all but a handful \u201csmall and medium\u201d in size) in the first quarter of 1984, but that number had declined to 6,570 by the third quarter of 2010, when Dodd-Frank was signed into law.\n\nThat\u2019s a fairly steady decrease of 54 percent over 26-and-a-half years. And since then, the number has declined further to 5,501 as of the first quarter of this year. That\u2019s a drop of 16 percent (not \u201cover 40 percent\u201d) in four-and-a-half years.\n\nTrump\u2019s Wealth Claim\n\nDonald Trump repeated his claim that his net worth is $10 billion.\n\nTrump: The fact is, I built a net worth of more than $10 billion. I have a great, great company. I employ thousands of people. And I\u2019m very proud of the job I did.\n\nThere\u2019s ample reason to think he\u2019s exaggerating. For one thing, in June Trump himself released a statement putting his net worth at less \u2014 $8.7 billion. In July, he increased that figure to $10 billion, touting his ability to assemble \u201cmassive\u201d wealth as a reason voters should support him.\n\nBut outside estimates are far lower. Forbes estimated his net worth at $4 billion, ranking him in 405th place among its listing of the world\u2019s wealthiest people (the fluctuating \u201creal-time\u201d ranking by Forbes has him at 430th, as of this writing).\n\nLater, the Bloomberg Billionaire\u2019s Index, after examining the 92-page disclosure of assets and liabilities that Trump filed with the Federal Election Commission, came up with an even lower estimate: $2.9 billion.\n\nTrump once testified in a lawsuit that his estimate of his own net worth \u201cfluctuates\u201d partly due to \u201cattitudes and with feelings, even my own feelings.\u201d\n\nJudging by Trump\u2019s $10 billion claim, he\u2019s feeling very good. But even if he is worth less than a third of what he claims (as Bloomberg estimates), he\u2019s still a very rich person.\n\nBush\u2019s Tax Cut Boast\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush claimed \u2014 twice \u2014 that as governor of Florida he cut taxes by $19 billion. But a big chunk of that came from cuts in Florida estate taxes mandated by federal law that Bush had nothing to do with.\n\nBush: I cut taxes ever year totaling $19 billion.\n\nHe repeated the tax cut figure later in the debate when asked about disparaging comments he allegedly made about Trump.\n\nBush\u2019s Right to Rise PAC told Politifact Florida that the figure was based on cumulative changes in revenue between the fiscal years 1999-2000 and 2007-2008. But not all of the revenue changes were due to tax cuts. They also included various fees and license changes, as well as sales tax holidays and lottery proceeds, according to the Politifact Florida analysis.\n\nIn addition, Martin A. Sullivan, chief economist of Tax Analysts, a tax news nonprofit organization, did his own analysis and found that state legislation enacted during Bush\u2019s eight years as governor resulted in $13 billion in tax cuts.\n\n\u201cMy estimate \u2014 following the method used by the Florida Legislature \u2014 includes nontax revenue increases such as new lottery and slot machine revenue, and it does not include automatic cuts in Florida estate taxes brought about by changes in federal legislation in 2003,\u201d Sullivan wrote.\n\nHe added: \u201cThese factors probably explain most of the difference between my estimate and the Bush website\u2019s estimate.\u201d\n\nSullivan said that the $13 billion in cuts amounted to $140 per resident.\n\nKasich on Medicaid Expansion\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich defended his decision to expand Medicaid in his state under the ACA, saying that \u201cour Medicaid is growing at one of the lowest rates in the country.\u201d But Ohio\u2019s Medicaid rolls are 24 percent higher, compared with pre-ACA monthly enrollment. That puts the state at 16th in terms of growth among the 30 states and the District of Columbia that have expanded Medicaid.\n\nAccording to the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, Ohio\u2019s average monthly pre-ACA Medicaid and Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program enrollment was 2,341,481, using July-September 2013 numbers. The post-ACA monthly figure, as of May 2015, was 2,902,768, an increase of 24 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s true that some states saw much higher growth: Kentucky\u2019s enrollment shot up 86 percent; Oregon\u2019s is up 75 percent. Several other states are at 50 percent growth and above, including Arkansas, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Washington and West Virginia.\n\nBut Ohio is in the middle of the pack, not \u201cone of the lowest rates in the country.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s growth is slightly above the 22 percent average for all states, including nonexpansion states.\n\nWalker Spins Job Growth\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, when asked about failing to keep a campaign promise to create 250,000 jobs in his first term, responded with some spin on the state\u2019s unemployment rate and job growth.\n\nWalker: Before I came in, the unemployment rate was over 8 percent. It\u2019s now down to 4.6 percent. We\u2019ve more than made up for the jobs that were lost during the recession.\n\nThe claim that the state \u201cmore than made up\u201d for the job losses from the recession is a stretch. In December 2007, when the recession started, the state had 2,878,000 jobs, and as of June it had 2,882,000 jobs \u2014 a net gain of just 4,000 jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nWalker is right about the state\u2019s unemployment rate, but it begs for some context.\n\nThe state\u2019s rate was 8 percent when Walker took office in January 2011 \u2014 a full 1.2 percentage points lower than the U.S. unemployment rate. As of June, Wisconsin\u2019s rate was 4.6 percent \u2014 0.7 percentage points lower than the U.S. at large.\n\nSo, under Walker, the state\u2019s job growth has not kept pace with the rest of the country \u2014 which is reflected in the fact that Wisconsin ranks 34th in job growth rate during his time as governor. Since January 2011, Wisconsin has a job growth rate of 5.1 percent, while the U.S. as a whole has a rate of 8.4 percent.\n\nRubio\u2019s Stance on Abortion\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio said he had never advocated an exception to abortion bans for victims of rape or incest, but he cosponsored a bill in 2013 that contained just such exceptions.\n\nFox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly began a question to Rubio by saying he \u201cfavor[s] a rape and incest exception to abortion bans.\u201d Rubio answered:\n\nRubio: Well, Megyn, first of all, I\u2019m not sure that that\u2019s a correct assessment of my record. I would go on to add that I believe all\u2013 Kelly: You don\u2019t favor a rape and incest exception? Rubio: I have never said that. And I have never advocated that. What I have advocated is that we pass law in this country that says all human life at every stage of its development is worthy of protection.\n\nThough we can find no specific comments the senator made on this issue, he was an original cosponsor of a bill in 2013 called the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. (The House passed a similar bill earlier this year, and we wrote about the uncertain science regarding fetal pain.) That bill prohibits abortion beyond 20 weeks gestation except in cases where the mother\u2019s life is in danger, and where:\n\nSenate bill 1670, November 2013: [T]he pregnancy is the result of rape, or the result of incest against a minor, if the rape has been reported at any time prior to the abortion to an appropriate law enforcement agency, or if the incest against a minor has been reported at any time prior to the abortion to an appropriate law enforcement agency or to a government agency legally authorized to act on reports of child abuse or neglect.\n\nRubio made no further comment during his answer on whether he currently supports such exceptions. Although he is entitled to change his opinion over time, his claim that he never supported exceptions to abortion laws regarding rape or incest is false.\n\nBush Overhypes Graduation Rate Increases\n\nBoasting about education changes he initiated as Florida governor, Bush claimed, \u201cOur graduation rate improved by 50 percent.\u201d According to the federal uniform graduation rate calculations, however, Florida\u2019s graduation rate increased by about 13 percent when Bush was governor.\n\nThe Bush campaign pointed us to statistics that showed graduation rates have increased more than 46 percent from the time Bush took office until 2013-2014. But most of that increase took place after Bush left office in 2007, and the context of Bush\u2019s comments left the impression he was talking about gains made during his time in office.\n\nBush: I\u2019m for higher standards measured in an intellectually honest way, with abundant school choice, ending social promotion. And I know how to do this because as governor of the state of Florida I created the first statewide voucher program in the country, the second statewide voucher program, in the country and the third statewide voucher program in the country. And we had rising student achievement across the board, because high standards, robust accountability, ending social promotion in third grade, real school choice across the board, challenging the teachers union and beating them is the way to go. And Florida\u2019s low-income kids had the greatest gains inside the country. Our graduation rate improved by 50 percent. That\u2019s what I\u2019m for.\n\nThere are several different ways to calculate graduation rates, and when we reached out to the Bush campaign for backup, it pointed to a Florida Department of Education report on \u201cHistorical Summary of Florida\u2019s Graduation Rate.\u201d According to the FDE methodology, the Florida graduation rate in 1998-1999 \u2014 which takes in Bush\u2019s first year in office \u2014 was 60.2 percent. It went up to 71 percent in 2005-2006, the last full school year under Bush. That\u2019s an 18 percent increase.\n\nThe report also lists the \u201cfederal uniform graduation rate,\u201d which climbed from 52 percent in 1998-1999 to 58.8 percent in 2005-2006. That\u2019s a 13 percent increase. Using that methodology, the rate increased to 76.1 percent in 2013-2014. That comes to a 46 percent increase between the time Bush took office until the latest available year of data in 2013-2014. That\u2019s the increase to which the Bush campaign says Bush was referring.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education\u2019s statistics on average freshman graduation rates for public secondary schools show a more modest gain in graduation rates under Bush, from 61.4 percent in 1998-1999 to 63.6 percent in 2005-2006. That\u2019s just under a 4 percent gain. The 2005-2006 rate ranked Florida 45th out of 50 states.\n\nBush on Education Spending\n\nBush said that the U.S. spends \u201cmore per student than any country in the world other than a couple rounding errors.\u201d Not so.\n\nBush: Because today in America, a third of our kids, after we spend more per student than any other country in the world other than a couple rounding errors, to be honest with you, 30 percent are college- and/or career-ready.\n\nAccording to the 2014 \u201cEducation at a Glance\u201d report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, based on 2011 data, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Norway all spent more per student on primary and secondary education than the U.S. (see chart B1.2a on page 207). The U.S. was only the leader in per-student spending on tertiary education.\n\nBut there is support for Bush\u2019s claim that 30 percent of high school students are college ready.\n\nThe 2014 ACT College Readiness report, according to a press release, showed that just 39 percent of ACT-tested high school graduates \u201cmet three or more of the four ACT College Readiness Benchmarks in English, math, reading and science, suggesting they are well prepared for first-year college coursework.\u201d What\u2019s more, 31 percent, or almost 1 out of 3 students, didn\u2019t meet any of the benchmarks.\n\nHuckabee\u2019s Obamacare Talking Point\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee repeated a years-old Republican talking point in saying that Obamacare \u201crobbed\u201d Medicare of $700 billion. That\u2019s a $716 billion cut in the future growth of spending of Medicare over 10 years \u2014 not a slashing of the current budget, or taking money from the Medicare trust fund.\n\nHuckabee: And, if Congress wants to mess with the retirement program, why don\u2019t we let them start by changing their retirement program, and not have one, instead of talking about getting rid of Social Security and Medicare that was robbed $700 billion to pay for Obamacare.\n\nWe\u2019ve covered this claim many times, including in May, when Huckabee used the line in announcing his presidential candidacy. It was one of the whoppers of the 2012 presidential campaign.\n\nThe ACA called for reducing the future growth of spending primarily by reducing the growth of payments to hospitals and Medicare Advantage payments. Spending less than had been expected is good for Medicare\u2019s finances, as we explained before. We\u2019ve also said that experts question whether some of the cuts actually will be implemented. But if they are, Medicare will be able to stretch its revenues for a longer time than they would last otherwise.\n\n\u2014 by Eugene Kiely, Brooks Jackson, Lori Robertson, Robert Farley, Dave Levitan and D\u2019Angelo Gore\n\nSources\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
