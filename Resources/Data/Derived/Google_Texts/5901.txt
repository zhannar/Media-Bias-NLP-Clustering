Heastie and Cuomo. | Office of the Governor of New York Leaders agree on some health items, with capital funding unsettled

ALBANY—Governor Andrew Cuomo and legislative leaders have reached an agreement on the health and mental hygiene portion of the state's 2015-16 fiscal year budget, but still have yet to reach an agreement on some of the most controversial health care proposals elsewhere in the state's $141.6 billion spending plan.

Cuomo's initial budget proposed $1.4 billion in capital spending on hospitals, split three ways: $700 million would go to build a new hospital in Brooklyn, where many hospitals considered critical access providers for low-income or underserved communities have struggled in recent years. $300 million would have gone to health providers in Oneida County, and $400 million would have been set aside for struggling rural hospitals in upstate New York.

Both the Assembly and the Senate disagreed with Cuomo's plans. The Senate's one-house budget added $500 million to the proposed capital spending plan, and didn't delineate exactly where the capital money would go, saying funding should be allocated according to an agreement between the governor and legislative leaders. The Assembly's one-house budget carved out some of the capital funding reserved for upstate rural hospitals to go toward Roswell Park Cancer Institute.

What has been settled:

--The budget would create a Health Care Reform Act (HCRA) Modernization Task Force, "to evaluate and make recommendations regarding the efficacy and transparency of the Health Care Reform Act resources fund (HCRA fund) and to evaluate and modernize the provisions of law related to the Health Care Reform Acts of 1996 and 2000."

HCRA, a tax that insurers have paid since the late 90s under health reform legislation enacted during the Pataki administration, has come under scrutiny recently because of the role the tax's collections paid in an alleged fraud scheme by former Assembly speaker Sheldon Silver. The tax now collects $5.5 billion a year, but for many years, at least some of it its collections and disbursements have been something of a mystery. And for several years in the mid-2000s, hundreds of millions of dollars collected under the tax were allocated to the legislative leaders to spend with little oversight. The HCRA Modernization Task Force would re-evaluate the HCRA fund and determine whether parts of the original HCRA law are now obsolete, and would deliver a final report by December 31, 2015.

--The budget approves the creation of a Basic Health Program, an insurance program available under the Affordable Care Act that provides insurance for people whose incomes are between 138 and 200 percent of the federal poverty level. But the budget also requires the health department to submit a report to the Legislature within the coming months detailing the impact the Basic Health Plan could have on other insurance products available on the state's health exchange, and to develop a "contingency" plan in the event the federal government, which will fund the majority of costs for the new BHP enrollees, decides to pull the plug on the program.

--The Legislature cut the Cuomo Administration's proposal to allow a demonstration project for private equity investment in hospitals.

--The governor's proposal to give the health commissioner broad discretion in determining criteria for value-based purchasing has been cut.

--The governor and leaders greed to continue the state's physician profiles program, a state-run website that lists doctors and contains information about any malpractice or other pending claims against them. Cuomo had proposed eliminating the site, drawing an outcry from consumer and patient advocacy groups. The deal also requires that the state health department "study" the feasibility of requiring doctors to disclose which health plans they participate in on the same site.

--The budget would also allow the state's health commissioner to negotiate rebates directly with pharmaceutical companies for certain kinds of drugs, including HIV/AIDS drugs and Hepatitis C drug classes. A number of new, highly effective therapies to treat both Hepatitis C and HIV/AIDS have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in recent years, but their extraordinary costs have raised questions about states' ability to pay the sticker price.

--The budget includes language specifying that neither condoms nor hypodermic syringes obtained through the state's needle exchange programs could be used as evidence against someone in a criminal proceeding.

--Office-based surgery centers would be subject to new reporting requirements.

--The leaders agreed to allow school districts and schools to administer opioid overdose treatments after being trained in their use.
