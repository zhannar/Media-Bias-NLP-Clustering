Congressional appropriators axed the IRS budget for this fiscal year in the omnibus budget bill released last night and also took aim at the agency for its scrutiny of conservative tea party groups. The agency was allocated $11.2 billion \u2014 a reduction from its $12 billion budget during the 2013 fiscal year and a significant drop from the figure IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said the agency needs to tackle tax collection, fraud and Obamacare.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe Obama administration asked Congress for nearly $13 billion for the IRS. The drop was not unexpected after the agency was harshly criticized by congressional Republicans for targeting conservative tea party groups for extra scrutiny. The omnibus bill explicitly bans the agency from using the funds to \u201ctarget citizens of the United States for exercising any right guaranteed under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\u201d Congressional appropriators also took aim at the agency department faulted for the two-year target by mandating that at least $200,000 should be earmarked for \u201cintensive training of employees in the Exempt Organizations Unit.\u201d\n\nNO MORE SPOCK. The bill also prohibits the funds from being used to produce any videos unless approved by a \u201cService-Wide Video Editorial Board.\u201d The agency was slammed in 2013 for spending $60,000 to create a poorly-produced training video spoofing Star Trek.\n\nMORE MONEY FOR INSPECTOR GEORGE. But Congress did not skimp on money for the government watchdog that unveiled the depth of the target party targeting \u2014 even going above the White House\u2019s budget request. The White House asked that the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration be given $150,538,000 during the 2014 fiscal year and the omnibus language increases that funding to $156,375,000.\n\nTHE OMNIBUS BILL overall is a $1.1 trillion spending that \u201cfills in the blanks of the December budget agreement and promises to restore some order to government funding over the next year. Under pressure from Republicans, the measure keeps a tight rein on new funding for Wall Street regulators and effectively freezes appropriations for President Barack Obama\u2019s health care program at the reduced, post-sequester level. But the White House retains the flexibility to find the financing it needs to implement the health exchanges and appears satisfied to have avoided the most contentious restrictions proposed by conservatives,\u201d my colleague David Rogers reports.

The FBI is unlikely suggest that criminal charges be levied against any officials at the IRS over the tea party targeting controversy, officials close to the probe told the Wall Street Journal. If true, a lack of criminal penalties would serve as a confirmation that no agency official leaked or shared private taxpayer information or broke the law when targeting the tea party groups. A DOJ spokesman had no comment on the report and a law enforcement official stressed to POLITICO that the investigation is \u201congoing.\u201d\n\nThe report was met with frustration from House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa and fellow committee Republican Jim Jordan. \u201cAnonymous \u2014 and apparently politically motivated \u2014 leaks from unnamed law enforcement officials further undermine the public assurances by the current and former FBI directors that this is a legitimate investigation. These leaks come after the Justice Department, citing the confidential nature of the investigation, refused to brief Congress on its progress and congressional investigators independently discovered that a high dollar contributor to the Obama Administration failed to recuse herself,\u201d the pair said in a statement.

Oral arguments begin today in a case that could determine how lump-sum severance pay is taxed when a company shuts down, with implications for the government into the $1 billion-range. The case, United States v. Quality Stores Inc., involves a dispute over how federal statutes define what income falls under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax withholding. Quality Stores, which shut down in 2001, withheld FICA taxes for their employees in their severance pay. The company still argues the withholding was unnecessary as a portion of the tax code says \"supplemental unemployment benefits\" are exempt from the tax. But that conflicts with a separate aspect of the code that says \u201call remuneration for employment\u201d should face the FICA taxes. It\u2019s a gray code, Marianna Dyson of Miller & Chevalier told Morning Tax. \u201cThe straightforwardness of the statutory argument and the fact that the IRS has frankly been rather schizophrenic in its issue of these tax rulings\u2026will help the taxpayer,\u201d she said.

Reuters\u2019 Patrick Temple-West has the story, \u201cIn a win for the Obama administration's fight against offshore tax evasion, a U.S. federal judge on Monday dismissed a lawsuit challenging new rules forcing U.S. banks to tell the Internal Revenue Service about certain accounts held by foreigners. Set to take effect in March, the rules are part of a fast-emerging global web of bank information-sharing agreements between the United States and many other countries meant to combat the hiding of assets abroad to avoid paying taxes.\u201d http://reut.rs/1hREpEI\n\nOBAMACARE NOT A DEBT CEILING WEAPON THIS TIME. Seung Min Kim reports, \u201cHill Republicans are starting to whip up their wish lists for the debt limit battle later this year. Missing from many of those lists: Obamacare. The debt limit will have to be hiked sometime between late February and early June, depending on various government estimates. But congressional Republicans from across the ideological spectrum are already skeptical of trying to extract concessions from Democrats on the Affordable Care Act \u2014 a dynamic that triggered an unpopular government shutdown last fall.\u201d http://politi.co/1eBtERH\n\nSWISS TACK ON WHISTLEBLOWERS COULD CHILL U.S. TAX EVASION EFFORTS. Rachael Bade reports, \u201cSwitzerland is taking a new tack to protect its prized banking secrecy \u2014 one that could undermine the race by U.S. tax authorities to snag tax evaders stashing funds offshore. The country, which bars citizens from dishing banking secrets to foreign governments, is probing former Swiss banker Renzo Gadola for spilling the beans on rich Americans with hidden bank accounts, according to the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland\u2026The Swiss contend they\u2019re merely upholding their privacy laws, but some say the investigation sends a message to bankers: Keep quiet or else.\u201d http://politico.pro/1iJFFaC\n\nWHAT PROS ARE READING: NO HOPE FOR EXTENDERS. Brian Faler writes, \u201cThose wondering about the fate of some 55 just-expired tax breaks known as extenders might want to settle in. Congress is unlikely to renew them anytime soon, and some observers predict this will be the toughest year yet to revive them. Many may never be renewed, said Greg Valliere, chief political strategist at the Potomac Research Group\u2026But as their leaders\u2019 agenda suggests, House Republicans have no plans to take them up anytime soon. Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp has not given up on tax reform, and renewing the provisions now would amount to waiving the white flag.\u201d http://politico.pro/1hSGW1p\n\nFIRST LOOK \u2014 ASSOCIATION OF NATIONAL ADVERTISERS TO CONGRESS: DON\u2019T TAX THESE ADS. The Association of National Advertisers is out with a study today focusing on the negative consequences they predict if Congress moves forward with proposal to restrict the deduction available for advertising expenses. Designed to boost support for the advertising industry, the study is also an attempt to push back against congressional proposals from Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus that would reduce the deduction allowed for advertising expenses to 50 percent and spread out the deduction period to five years instead of the traditional one-year period. The study found that reducing the tax deduction from 100 percent to 50 percent could create a $456 billion loss in sales and at least 1.7 million jobs lost. View it here: http://bit.ly/L4xxGm.

Bush administrations official Bruce Bartlett writes, \u201cThe taxation of capital gains has always been among the most politically contentious elements of the tax code and will be among the most difficult to resolve when fundamental tax reform is undertaken.
