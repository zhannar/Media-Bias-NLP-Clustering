'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet': Obamacare website displays nonsense text to users nearly a YEAR after troubled rollout – and some in Congress have the same problem

Graphic designers use Latin-like nonsense text to temporarily plan pages before writers finish writing

On more than a dozen critical Healthcare.gov pages, the dummy text has never been replaced with the real thing nearly a year after the public launch



The Illinois Obamacare exchange's website has the same problem, as do several belonging to members of Congress

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began pulling down the faulty Web pages on Friday, with one official saying 'We'll fix it ... in our own time'



A full 318 days after the Obama administration's medical insurance overhaul website's glitch-prone launch, taxpayers visiting healthcare.gov for critical information are instead encountering 'Lorem ipsum' – Latin-language filler text used by graphic designers as a placeholder when they don't yet have meaningful information to publish.

The nonsense words appear when users reach Web pages dedicated to 'why health coverage is important,' 'how to appeal a Marketplace decision,' 'health coverage for military veterans' and the unemployed, and 'who's eligible to use the Marketplace.'

In all, MailOnline found 13 mission-critical pages on the site that provided no meaningful information – just 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet ...'



Other affected areas of the site include 'reporting income and household size,' 'health coverage for immigrants,' what to do 'if you have Medicare,' 're-enrolling in the Marketplace' and 'Health coverage for incarcerated people.'



And users looking to 'Renew or Change a Plan' are met with a trio of online mini-chapters consisting only of the words: 'Add bite content here.'

Nearly a year after its troubled launch, some critical pages on the healthcare.gov website still spout gibberish text

The Weekly Standard first reported a few of the anomalies Friday morning. Shortly after MailOnline completed its search, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began pulling the pages down.

Now users navigating to the previously unfinished pages are met with a message: 'Sorry, we can't find that page on HealthCare.gov.' We've recently reorganized our site, and that may explain it. It's also possible that you mistyped the address.



Google's robust automatic cache recorded copies of the flawed pages, but by noontime those, to, began to disappear.

The search giant's corporate headquarters did not respond to requests for comment. But a flustered official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, speaking on condition of anonymity, conceded that the resulting picture didn't look good.

It's 'something that should never have been left hanging for this long,' said the official, who is not authorized to speak publicly. '[Our] tech teams scrambled mid-morning. What can I say?'

'LOREM IPSUM': Dummy text that's supposed to be temporary

For centuries, typesetters and graphic designers have used Latin-style nonsense words like these to plan their pages long before writers have decided what to communicate. The beginning of the text dates back to at least 45 B.C., but the rest is completely meaningless:

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sumenda potius quam expetenda. Ut optime, secundum naturam affectum esse possit.

Quid iudicant sensus? Cum salvum esse flentes sui respondissent, rogavit essentne fusi hostes. Ita nemo beato beatior. Duo Reges: constructio interrete. Quo modo autem philosophus loquitur?

Et si turpitudinem fugimus in statu et motu corporis, quid est cur pulchritudinem non sequamur? Sin tantum modo ad indicia veteris memoriae cognoscenda, curiosorum. Dici enim nihil potest verius. Sint ista Graecorum; In his igitur partibus duabus nihil erat, quod Zeno commutare gestiret.



'We'll fix it, sure. In our own time ,' he told MailOnline. 'We're really focused on the back-end of the site right now, getting insurers paid and making sure collected premiums are being assigned to the correct accounts.'

Temporarily inserting 'Lorem Ipsum' text – meaningless but standardized strings of Latin – into the Obamacare website appears to have been a common practice for code monkeys as well as art directors.

One lengthy page of javascript language computer code, designed to implement the health insurance registration process, still includes at least 17 separate snippets of 'Lorem ipsum.'

Some state-level Obamacare exchanges also suffer from the same problem. The Get Covered Illinois website includes a page – full of 'Lorem ipsum' – intended to help consumers choose their insurance plans.



Congress, too, has its share of lazy Web coders who have left a trail of the placeholder words in their wake.

Rep. Danny Davis, an Illinois Democrat, provides his constituents with an online explanation of the rationale behind his decision to vote in favor of the Affordable Care Act. Its entire contents are 'Lorem ipsum' words.

Another Democratic lawmaker, Rep. David Price of North Carolina, has published three paragraphs of the text in place of a press release. Staffers of Arizona Democratic Rep. Ed Pastor and California Republican Rep. John Campbell appear to have made the same error.



The website of the Congressional Victims' Rights Caucus, a group founded by Texas Republican Rep. Ted Poe and California Democratic Rep. Jim Costa, includes a 2012 press release that consists of nothing but the dummy text.

Military veterans, too, are stung by the nonsense copy on Healthcare.gov

The Office of General Counsel (OGC) of the House of Representatives, too, features online press releases and one op-ed that are little more than 'Lorem ipsum.

The OGC is the office that will soon file House Speaker John Boehner's landmark federal lawsuit against President Barack Obama, inspired by the White House's changes to the Obamacare law.

And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention



Some savvy Web designers have devised ways to use dummy text without leaving a trail of breadcrumbs in case the fake words remain there longer than intended.

Tricks include the use of online custom text generators which provide endless paragraphs of real-looking but nonsensical words based on limited dictionaries tailored to specific interests.

One assembles text that reads like a page from a Samuel L. Jackson movie. The output from another reads like the stylings of the artist formerly known as Snoop Dogg.



There's a text generator for hipster language like ' Vinyl flexitarian pour-over farm-to-table, street art meggings slow-carb put a bird on it scenester chambray shabby chic.'

Yet another capitalizes on the popularity of pork bellies.
