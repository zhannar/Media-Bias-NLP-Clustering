Facing perhaps the most difficult re-election of his career, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, is getting an early start against Representative Ann Kirkpatrick, the likely Democratic candidate in the race, with a new television ad hitting her for her strong support of the Affordable Care Act.

The advertisement, Mr. McCain’s first television ad of the election cycle, began airing on Tuesday on network affiliates in Phoenix. It replays an interview in which Ms. Kirkpatrick declares that the health care law is the vote she is most proud of, while recounting problems with the new insurance coverage in Arizona, including premium increases and the withdrawal from the plan by a major insurer.

“While Kirkpatrick’s proud of putting us at risk, John McCain is leading the fight to stop Obamacare,” the female announcer says.

Mr. McCain’s campaign has also established a new website hitting his Republican primary opponent Kelli Ward, a former state legislator, for various provocative statements and actions, leaving Mr. McCain punching in two directions. The primary election is not until Aug. 30, and Mr. McCain’s decision to start attacking Ms. Kirkpatrick shows he is not willing to risk her getting a free pass until then.

Aware that Mr. McCain is increasingly seen as vulnerable in his fight for a sixth term, his campaign team issued a memo this week noting his sizable fund-raising advantage and extensive grass-roots organizing efforts.
