Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, will lead the platform committee for the Republican National Convention, officials said Tuesday.

Mr. Barrasso’s role had been anticipated for weeks. But the platform committee’s work took on new significance after the party’s presumptive presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, suggested that he would like to see changes made to a platform that has been essentially the same since the days of Ronald Reagan.

Mr. Barrasso said that the process of writing the platform would be driven by the delegates, and that “it’s going to be a conservative platform that reflects our values, freedom, liberty and limited government.”

Mr. Barrasso, a doctor who frequently rails against the Affordable Care Act on the Senate floor, said that people should look for a health care component in the platform, an “issue that has united Republicans” and helped them win elections across the country, and for an energy component, which he called “a divisive issue for Democrats.”

Mr. Barrasso said that he met with Mr. Trump in Washington two weeks ago and that his takeaway was that “no presidential candidate has ever fully embraced the platform, but we expect absolute acceptance of it.” But attendees of those meetings said that Mr. Trump, a former Democrat, had made assurances that he would not seek to tinker with the platform.

Mr. Barrasso is a member of the Senate Republican leadership team serving as chairman of the Republican Policy Committee.
