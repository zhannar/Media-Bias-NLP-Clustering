(NYSE: ANR) (\"Alpha\"), a leading U.S. coal supplier, today announced that it has completed the repurchase of an aggregate of approximately $593 million in principal amount of its unsecured notes, including $82 million principal amount of its 3.75% convertible notes due 2017, $108 million principal amount of its 9.75% senior notes due 2018, $220 million principal amount of its 6.00% senior notes due 2019, $68 million principal amount of its 4.875% convertible notes due 2020 and $115 million principal amount of its 6.25% senior notes due 2021, in separate privately negotiated transactions with investors. Alpha funded the aggregate repurchase price of approximately $331 million for the unsecured notes through a combination of proceeds from the issuance of $214 million principal amount of 7.50% senior secured second lien notes due 2020 (Series B) (the \"Series B Notes\") and $117 million of cash on hand.\n\nThe repurchase of the unsecured notes and issuance of new Series B Notes results in a reduction in Alpha's consolidated net indebtedness of approximately $379 million, and reduces Alpha's anticipated annual cash paid for interest by approximately $21 million. As a result of the transactions, Alpha is revising its guidance for 2015 cash paid for interest from a range of $245-$255 million to a range of $230-$240 million.\n\nPhilip J. Cavatoni, Alpha's Executive Vice President & Chief Financial and Strategy Officer, said, \"The transactions announced today illustrate Alpha's continuing ability to take advantage of opportunities in the financial markets to proactively strengthen the company's balance sheet. We were able to achieve a meaningful deleveraging of our balance sheet while reducing cash interest payments. These steps increase our financial flexibility as we continue to manage through ongoing challenges in the domestic and international coal markets.\"\n\nThe newly issued Series B Notes have the same terms as Alpha's 7.50% senior secured second lien notes due 2020 that were issued on May 20, 2014, but constitute a new series of notes issued under a separate indenture and CUSIP and will vote as a separate class on all matters that require action of the noteholders. The Series B Notes are guaranteed by each of Alpha's current and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries that guarantee Alpha's obligations under Alpha's credit agreement. The Series B Notes and the guarantees are secured by second priority liens on the same collateral securing on a first priority lien basis indebtedness incurred under the credit agreement, and will consist of substantially all of Alpha's assets and the assets of Alpha's subsidiary guarantors.\n\nThe Series B Notes were offered and sold in the United States only to qualified institutional buyers and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons, in each case in private placements exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). The Series B Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act.\n\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of the notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.\n\nAbout Alpha Natural Resources\n\nAlpha Natural Resources is one of the largest and most regionally diversified coal suppliers in the United States.
