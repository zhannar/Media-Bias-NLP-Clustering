Providers should also focus on bringing patients and their caregivers into the decision-making environment by discussing their concerns about near-miss events or incorrect diagnoses in a non-judgmental manner.\n\nTo facilitate these objectives, providers must ensure that their electronic health records are current, complete, and accurate, and that they can receive necessary information from their external partners through health information exchange or other means.\n\nEducators should make sure that clinicians are equipped with the strategies and training to communicate effectively with partners and patients, employ evidence-based medicine while diagnosing, and using health IT tools to maximum effect.\n\nAs the Office of the National Coordinator and CMS work to develop higher levels of interoperability within the EHR ecosystem, and vendors continue to produce innovative clinical decision support tools with predictive analytics and risk stratification features, providers will be better armed to identify conditions and effectively assess a patient\u2019s needs.\n\n\u201cHealth IT vendors and the ONC should work together with users to ensure that health IT used in the diagnostic process demonstrates usability, incorporates human factors knowledge, integrates measurement capability, fits well within clinical workflow, provides clinical decision support, and facilitates the timely flow of information among patients and health care professionals involved in the diagnostic process,\u201d IOM suggests.\n\nThe report also urges rule makers to strengthen their certification and requirements in an effort to improve interoperability and ensure that vendor products do not inadvertently create additional opportunities for patient safety errors due to inadequate usability or poorly designed workflows.\n\nWhen errors do occur, they should be reported in a timely and meaningful way, the report adds. Healthcare organizations should internally monitor their diagnosis processes in order to identify and learn from diagnostic errors and near-miss events, IOM says.\n\nProviders should have clear and comprehensive procedures in place to collect systematic feedback on clinician performance, as well as a supportive culture for reporting adverse events.\n\n\u201cIf we truly want a collaborative approach to patient care, health care systems need to encourage these interactions without penalizing providers for examining errors when they do occur. We are pleased to see the IOM recognize this,\u201d said Bibb Allen, Jr., MD, FACR, chair of the American College of Radiology Board of Chancellors, in a statement supporting the IOM\u2019s recommendations.\n\n\u201cFurther minimizing diagnostic errors must involve patients and providers working together and leverage advancing technology to ensure safe, appropriate and accurate care,\u201d he continued.\n\nThe healthcare system must also continue to make reimbursement reforms that support collaborative care and information sharing, the IOM adds. Under traditional fee-for-service models, clinicians often have difficulty spending adequate time with patients while still meeting the demands of volume, which may limit their ability to dive deeply enough into complex cases.\n\nShifting towards accountable care arrangements that reward positive outcomes and the delivery of patient-centered care may be an important step towards improving the diagnostic process. Complementing these financial reforms with additional funding for ongoing research and the development of precision medicine will also contribute to the provision of high-quality, person-centered treatments that promote patient safety and provider accountability.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Electronic health records, clinical decision support tools, and better training are required to improve diagnostics and patient safety, IOM says.", "author": "HealthITAnalytics", "og": {"url": "http://healthitanalytics.com/news/iom-use-ehrs-more-efficiently-for-patient-safety-diagnostics", "site_name": "HealthITAnalytics", "image": "http://healthitanalytics.com/images/site/articles/ThinkstockPhotos-453623307-2.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "IOM: Use EHRs More Efficiently for Patient Safety, Diagnostics"}, "twitter": {"description": "Electronic health records, clinical decision support tools, and better training are required to improve diagnostics and patient safety, IOM says.", "creator": "@HITAnalytics", "image": {"src": "http://healthitanalytics.com/images/site/articles/ThinkstockPhotos-453623307-2.jpg"}, "title": "IOM: Use EHRs More Efficiently for Patient Safety, Diagnostics", "site": "@HITAnalytics", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Teamwork and training should be among the nation\u2019s top priorities for catching diagnostic errors before they produce adverse events.\n\u201cIf we truly want a collaborative approach to patient care, health care systems need to encourage these interactions without penalizing providers for examining errors when they do occur.\nHealthcare organizations should internally monitor their diagnosis processes in order to identify and learn from diagnostic errors and near-miss events, IOM says.\nShifting towards accountable care arrangements that reward positive outcomes and the delivery of patient-centered care may be an important step towards improving the diagnostic process.\n\u201cFurther minimizing diagnostic errors must involve patients and providers working together and leverage advancing technology to ensure safe, appropriate and accurate care,\u201d he continued."}
