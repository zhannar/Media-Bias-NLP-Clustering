Rick Scott has made the Affordable Care Act\u2019s cuts to Medicare Advantage a talking point early in his re-election campaign, no doubt spurred on by the fact more than 1.4 million Floridians are enrolled in the program.\n\nIn an April 3, 2014, Spanish-language editorial in El Nuevo Herald , Scott brought up several talking points about the program, including threatened premium increases. \"Seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage are going to see an average premium increase between $50 and $90 per month,\" he wrote.\n\nMany private insurers warned premiums would increase under Obamacare, but we wondered if they would go up as high as Scott said.\n\nAfter Scott's op-ed published and while we were working on this report, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid announced it would give Medicare Advantage a little more money next year rather than a bit less. But we still wanted to see where Scott got his numbers from and if they added up.\n\nFirst, though, let\u2019s take a look at how Medicare Advantage works.\n\nHow is Medicare Advantage different?\n\nMedicare became available in 1965, offering retirees both hospital insurance (Part A) and medical insurance for doctors visits (Part B). Lawmakers in the 1970s started suggesting private insurers could offer Medicare benefits at a lower rate than the government-run program. By 2003, those private plans came to be known as Medicare Advantage.\n\nYou can read about the differences between the government-run and private programs here.\n\nAbout 30 percent of all Medicare recipients nationwide are enrolled in an Advantage plan. That ratio is about the same in Florida, with 1.4 million in Medicare Advantage and 4.4 million enrolled in Medicare , the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services says.\n\nThe advantage in Medicare Advantage was ostensibly the savings private companies would realize over what the federal government pays. In reality, that\u2019s not the case; Advantage plans were subsidized at about 14 percent more than regular plans by 2009, when Obamacare was being debated. Some estimates put that overage at about 9 percent or so now.\n\nWhen the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010, one of the attempts to pay for subsidized health insurance was to cut payments to the Medicare Advantage program to bring costs more in line with traditional Medicare.\n\nThe proposal spurred an outcry from private insurers, which said the only alternatives they had were to cut services, shrink networks and increase premiums while cutting into the program\u2019s enrollment. Enrollment has actually gone up, with a 9 percent increase between 2012 and 2013 alone, and about 30 percent since the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010.\n\nParsing payments\n\nBut what about premium increases?\n\nInsurance industry advocacy group America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) insists Advantage plans faced cuts of about 6 percent, after a combination of sequestration, a reduction in subsidies, the elimination of bonuses the government paid for quality plans and Obamacare\u2019s tax on premiums.\n\nAt the start of every year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services sets rates for Medicare Advantage so private insurers can bid on selling policies. Those rates are then revised in April and set for the year.\n\nScott\u2019s campaign directed us to an AHIP-commissioned report from February 2013 that stated on a per member, per month basis, Medicare Advantage patients could potentially face premium increases and benefit reductions in 2014 that would cost $50 to $90 a month. It was a national number, not a Florida number, and was only an estimate based on that year\u2019s preliminary suggestion from the government. (AHIP\u2019s projected Florida increase was actually $50 to $60 .) AHIP did not readjust its estimates after payments were set in April 2013.\n\nThis year AHIP released a new report that stated on a per member, per month basis, Medicare Advantage patients nationwide could have faced premium increases of $35 to $75, te report said. In Florida those potential increases could have been $35 to $45 by 2015 .\n\nAHIP spokesman Robert Zirkelbach said Scott used a number the group estimated, but it was taken from an old projection.\n\n\"It seems to me if they were looking ahead, they should have used $35 to $75 in the latest report,\" Zirkelbach said. He added such a number shouldn\u2019t necessarily be used in definite terms, because AHIP changes its estimates based on the latest information. They will address the $35 to $45 estimate for Florida in this year\u2019s report after they have analyzed the rates that were proposed April 7, he said. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services changed its initial estimate of a 1.9 percent rate cut to a 0.4 percent increase for next year.\n\nWe have to note that we're checking what Scott said on April 3, before the federal government reversed its decision to cut payments for 2015 and slightly raise them instead. Even using an old estimate, Scott didn't know for sure that the cuts weren't going to happen.\n\nOther companies and insurance groups come up with their own projected cost increases, but they don\u2019t reflect the trend that the Affordable Care Act seems to be doing what it set out to do: lowering the costs of Medicare Advantage.\n\nJoe Baker, president of the nonprofit Medicare Rights Center, said that despite the \"scare scenarios and sky-is-falling stuff,\" enrollment is increasing, premiums are down almost 10 percent and coverage hasn\u2019t decreased. Premiums may one day increase, but that hasn\u2019t been the trend since 2010, he said.\n\n\"People have been forecasting problems and none of those problems have occurred,\" Baker said. He added that the insurance industry lobbyists (and anti-Obamacare lawmakers) who have been fighting the payment reductions are defending the higher-cost private plans at the expense of the cheaper government-run option, and still manage to make Advantage plans profitable.\n\n\"They want to keep market share, so they keep their product competitive,\" he said. \"They want as much reimbursement as possible. They\u2019re profit-making businesses, and even if they are nonprofit, they still care about margin.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nScott said in a Spanish-language editorial that \"seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage are going to see an average premium increase between $50 and $90 per month.\"\n\nThat\u2019s an estimate made by an insurance lobbying group back in 2013, based on government data that wasn\u2019t finalized. Experts we spoke to pointed out the estimate also was created in the best interest of the industry, seeking to maximize government reimbursements for private Advantage plans.\n\nEven the group that commissioned the report from which the projection was culled says it wasn\u2019t the proper number for Scott to use.\n\nWe should note that the numbers changed again shortly after Scott's editorial appeared. But even before that, the numbers Scott used were off.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that one day premiums may increase, but data since 2010 don\u2019t reflect that.
