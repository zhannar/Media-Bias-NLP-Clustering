Ted Cruz attacks the Fortune 500's 'radical gay marriage agenda'

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, boosted his populist bonafides with his right-wing base Thursday.

In response to "Big Business" backlash toward controversial “religious freedom” legislation in Indiana and Arkansas, the Texas senator went after major corporations opposing the policy.

He brought up the issue to a few hundred supporters in Sioux City, Iowa. From Fortune Magazine:

“The Fortune 500 is running shamelessly to endorse the radical gay marriage agenda over religious liberty to say: ‘We will persecute a Christian pastor, a Catholic priest, a Jewish rabbi. Any person of faith is subject to persecution if they dare disagree, if their religious faith parts way from their political commitment to gay marriage.'”

Companies like Wal-Mart, Apple, Microsoft, NASACAR and the NCAA have voiced disapproval of the “Religious Freedom Restoration Act.”

Cruz's attack won’t endear him to Wall Street or even center-right Republicans, but that’s what the lone wolf grassroots candidate wants. He raised $4 million in the first days of his White House bid with 95 percent of the money coming from donors giving $100 or less.

The junior senator knows what to say to keep his Tea Party fans energized. He’s not afraid to make controversial remarks as long as it keeps his base excited. That’s not something his likely establishment GOP challenger Jeb Bush can get away with. Unlike Cruz, Bush walked back his support of the Indiana law.
