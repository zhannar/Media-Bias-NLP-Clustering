But beyond the headlines, there\u2019s a quiet effort underway to reclaim the conversation.\n\nMore lawmakers than ever before are standing up to fight for reproductive rights, helping to pioneer a growing state movement to push for proactive legislation to safeguard abortion access. After decades of playing defense on issues related to abortion, pro-choice politicians are starting to take a more aggressive approach.\n\nAccording to the Guttmacher Institute, there was a noticeable shift in this area during the 2014 session, when \u201clegislators quickly showed a clear interest in protecting or expanding access to sexual and reproductive health care.\u201d Even in states like New York, where lawmakers have been split over advancing provisions related to abortion, there\u2019s momentum toward working on other areas of gender equality and reproductive health care.\n\nThis year, that trend appears to be continuing:\n\nOregon\n\nThis legislative session, Oregon lawmakers introduced a sweeping package of pro-choice legislation that would make the state the first in the country to ensure that every resident has coverage for abortion procedures under every form of insurance.\n\nThe Comprehensive Women\u2019s Health Bill would require that all health insurance plans \u2014 including public plans like the Medicaid program \u2014 to cover the full range of reproductive health services, including birth control, abortion, prenatal care, childbirth, and breast-feeding support. The bill also requires pharmacies to dispense a 12-month supply of birth control at one time without any additional co-pays.\n\n\u201cAs states across the country are stripping women of reproductive health services and coverage, Oregon is making strides to ensure that residents of our great state and their families all women and their families are healthy by providing a full range of reproductive health care, starting before she ever becomes pregnant and going through childbirth,\u201d Michele Stranger Hunter, the executive director of the Oregon Foundation for Reproductive Health and NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon, said in a statement encouraging the measure\u2019s passage.\n\nWisconsin\n\nAs a whole, Wisconsin is not a great state for abortion access. It has just a handful of clinics left, coupled with some of the harshest abortion restrictions in the nation. But local lawmakers are doing their part to make progress in this area.\n\nThis week, the city of Madison unanimously passed a resolution affirming that it\u2019s critical to fund reproductive health care, noting that \u201cfederal and state laws that place obstacles in the paths of women seeking abortion care take away those women\u2019s ability to make decisions and threaten the health of families.\u201d The resolution concludes that insurance coverage for abortion should be restored for public employees and low-income women in the Medicaid program, and calls on Wisconsin state lawmakers to move forward in this area.\n\n\u201cIn bringing forth this resolution, the Madison Common Council is taking a stand to say that the amount of money a woman has should not prohibit her from having an abortion,\u201d Lisa Subeck, who serves on the city council, said in a statement. \u201cThis is not what Madison stands for. With this resolution we are saying it loud and clear: we will not look the other way.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\n\nThe Golden State is a pioneer in the state-level effort to expand reproductive rights. In 2013, it enacted the first state law since 2006 designed to protect, rather than attack, abortion access \u2014 taking an unprecedented step to expand the pool of abortion providers throughout California.\n\nSince then, local lawmakers have continued to set an example. Last September, San Francisco became the first city in the country to take a stance against \u201csex-selective abortion bans,\u201d after its Board of Supervisors voted to approve a resolution that prohibits this type of law from being enacted. This week, Oakland \u2014 where nearly 20 percent of the population is Asian American \u2014 followed suit. The city council there passed its own resolution denouncing sex-selective abortion bans.\n\nThis type of abortion restriction bans the practice of ending a pregnancy based on a fetus\u2019 sex, and is based on harmful racial stereotypes that assume Asian American women don\u2019t value daughters. \u201cI am proud of the Oakland City Council for taking a stand today to say that policies like sex-selective abortion bans are dangerous, promote racial profiling of Asian Pacific Islander (API) women and don\u2019t belong in our state,\u201d Eveline Shen, the executive director of Forward Together, one of the reproductive justice groups that endorsed the resolution, said in a statement.\n\nWashington\n\nThis month, lawmakers in Washington re-introduced a measure that would require insurers to achieve \u201creproductive parity\u201d and offer coverage for abortion services alongside other types of common women\u2019s health care.\n\nUnder the legislation, if insurance plans offer maternity coverage, they\u2019ll also be mandated to cover abortion. Rep. Eileen Cody (D), who\u2019s spearheading the measure, believes it will help ensure that decisions about ending a pregnancy aren\u2019t dependent on \u201cyour employer or a health-insurance company\u201d that previously had the power to decide not to cover abortion.\n\nLike Oregon, the state is making unprecedented moves by proposing the mandatory insurance coverage of abortion. Although Obamacare took some steps to standardize coverage for preventative care like birth control services and cancer screenings, no state currently requires private insurance plans to cover abortion.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "As Congress fights over taxpayer funding for abortion, some local lawmakers are quietly working to change the conversation.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "As Congress fights over taxpayer funding for abortion, some local lawmakers are quietly working to change the conversation.", "title": "Four States That Are Actually Working To Protect Abortion Rights", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/03/19/3635955/abortion-rights-proactive-states/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/womens-health.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As Congress fights over taxpayer funding for abortion, some local lawmakers are quietly working to change the conversation.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/womens-health-321x214.jpg", "title": "Four States That Are Actually Working To Protect Abortion Rights", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/womens-health.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/womens-health.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-19T09:25:53+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda6d2\"", "article_summary": "Health Four States That Are Actually Working To Protect Abortion Rights CREDIT: AP Photo/Matt RourkeAs states move to enact hundreds of abortion restrictions, and fights over taxpayer funding for abortion derail bipartisan policy initiatives on Capitol Hill, it can be hard to see any progress in this area.\nLike Oregon, the state is making unprecedented moves by proposing the mandatory insurance coverage of abortion.\nAfter decades of playing defense on issues related to abortion, pro-choice politicians are starting to take a more aggressive approach.\nMore lawmakers than ever before are standing up to fight for reproductive rights, helping to pioneer a growing state movement to push for proactive legislation to safeguard abortion access.\nIn 2013, it enacted the first state law since 2006 designed to protect, rather than attack, abortion access \u2014 taking an unprecedented step to expand the pool of abortion providers throughout California."}
