Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has made no secret of the fact that he spanks his daughter when she misbehaves. He has also suggested the American people should deliver a “spanking” to Hillary Clinton.

Now, he is prescribing the same discipline for a protester who interrupted him during a rally in Indiana on Sunday.

“Apparently there’s a young man who’s having some problems,” Cruz said as the man yelled: “You suck!”

“Thank you, son,” Cruz replied, before adding that he believes “children should actually speak with respect.”

“Imagine what a different world it would be if someone had told Donald Trump that years ago,” he said. “You know, in my household, when a child behaves that way, they get a spanking.”

The exchange comes as Cruz and Trump are stumping for every last vote heading into to the Republican primary in Indiana on Tuesday. Trump leads Cruz by roughly 9 percentage points, 42%-32.7%, in the RealClearPolitics average of recent Hoosier polls. A win there could help solidify Trump’s claim to the nomination, while dealing Cruz a formidable blow.
