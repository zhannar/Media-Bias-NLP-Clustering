On Wednesday morning, Perez boarded Air Force Two and with Vice-President Joe Biden and flew to Columbus, Ohio, where they made the official public announcement inside Jeni\u2019s Splendid Ice Creams .\n\nThe new rule has been described by some as second only to the Affordable Care Act in its ability to affect the wellbeing of working- and middle-class Americans. Perez, who has been at the head of the US Department of Labor for nearly three years, has made the overtime rule a priority even as he has toured the country speaking to workers and advocating for other worker-friendly policies such as higher minimum wages at the local, state and federal level.\n\nRelated: Millions could get a raise under Obama administration\u2019s new overtime rules\n\nWith two-thirds of a year left until the new president is sworn in, Perez still has an intimidating list of unfinished business \u2013 paid leave, auto-enrolling US workers into 401K or other pension programs and a higher minimum wage among others\u2013 that he\u2019d like to accomplish. As the election nears, he may have even more on his plate: Perez is said to be a potential vice-presidential pick.\n\nHe is clearly unafraid of a challenge. Big business has come out swinging against his changes to paid leave. Perez is unfazed. \u201cWe are the only industrialized nation on the planet that does not have some form of paid leave. We are the only industrialized nation where paid leave is a partisan issue,\u201d Perez said.\n\n\u201cI got in trouble recently because I said: \u2018The United States and Papua New Guinea are the only nations on the planet that do not have some form of paid leave.\u2019 Someone approached me after and said: \u2018Hey, I am from Papua New Guinea and we have been taking an initiative. Stop dissing New Guinea.\u2019 So I want to note my own error and apologize for dissing New Guinea. We are alone as a nation.\u201d\n\nA good listener\n\n\u201cTom Perez has guts,\u201d said Michael Subin, executive director of the Montgomery County\u2019s criminal justice coordinating commission. \u201cWhen he sees injustice, he is not afraid to take on those committing the injustice.\u201d\n\nSubin and Perez worked together in the early 2000s when Perez served as a member and then a president of the Montgomery County council. Together they proposed the Perez-Subin bill that sought to limit predatory lending. According to Subin, Perez knows how to get things done.\n\n\u201cLot of legislators don\u2019t understand what they have to do and how the system works best. He was able to get things done because he was able to work with people,\u201d he said. \u201cHe understood what they were looking for, what their issues might have been regarding specific pieces of legislation. And he listened.\u201d\n\nMary Kay Henry, president of the SEIU \u2013 one of the largest labor unions in the US \u2013 enjoys working with Perez because \u201che gets us\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain struggles that people have. He is often telling me stories of people he has just met \u2013 about how they are stitching together two or three jobs to make ends meet and that we have to stop it. What are we going to do together to get things right? He has really been a privilege to work with.\u201d\n\nOne morning early in May, Perez made his way to Brooklyn\u2019s Sunset Park neighborhood to visit UnCommonGoods, an online and catalogue retailer. In a small conference room, six workers sat awaiting his arrival. Most of them had started at UnCommonGoods as seasonal workers and have then transitioned into permanent positions, quickly climbing the ladder within the company. UnCommonGoods is what Perez would describe as a \u201cconscious capitalism\u201d company focused on developing its workers by paying them well, listening to their feedback and incorporating that into how the company is managed.\n\n\u201cI came here for the job, but I stayed for the culture,\u201d said Joel Villa, an operations supervisor who started at the company in 2013. \u201c I can grow and learn here.\u201d\n\nAs he toured the UnCommonGoods warehouse, Perez displayed an easy charm. Spotting one of the workers with a staff-designed handheld scanner, he said: \u201cCan I see your gun for a minute?\u201d As the employee handed it over, Perez looked it over and posed for photos. \u201cIt\u2019s so elegant,\u201d he said handing it back. \u201cShow me what you\u2019re doing here?\u201d\n\nLater that day, Perez would go on to visit the kitchen of The Modern \u2013 one of Danny Meyer\u2019s restaurants with a no-tipping policy . He is as comfortable in a kitchen as he is in a warehouse, in a hard hat on a construction site or bending pipes in a garage. Making house calls, as he refers to his visits with employees and employers, is a key part of his job as a labor secretary and enables him to \u201cunderstand the angst\u201d of those Americans who still feel left behind in the economic recovery.\n\n\u201cPeople in this country are resilient. I\u2019ve met so many folks who got kicked to the side of the road in the Great Recession and they\u2019ve rebounded. They inspire me,\u201d he said. \u201cI also meet people who are trying their hardest and are working a full-time job and they are getting their food at a food pantry. I\u2019ve met a woman in Detroit a few months ago \u2013 she joined the Fight for $15 movement, mother of three. The night before I met her, she slept in her car with her three kids. That\u2019s not right. We can do better as a nation.\u201d\n\nJust days after his visit to Brooklyn, the Department of Labor released its April jobs report noting that the US economy added just 160,000 jobs , about 40,000 fewer than expected.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another solid report,\u201d Perez told the Guardian that afternoon, pointing out that the number of long-term unemployed has been dropping amid optimism about the US job market. \u201cThe percentage of long-term unemployed is the lowest in seven years.\u201d\n\nWith the unemployment rate reaching 5% \u2013 down from 10% in October 2009 \u2013 there are fewer workers on the market and employers are going to have to hire workers who \u201cmight have a 12-month hole on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve met these folks. They have incredible talent,\u201d said Perez. \u201cTheir only mistake \u2013 if you want to call it a mistake \u2013 is that they were at a wrong place at a wrong time during the Great Recession.\u201d\n\nRelated: The jobs doctor is in: US Labor secretary makes unemployment \u2018house calls\u2019\n\nOn a cold, wet February morning, Perez met half a dozen New Jerseyans who were over 55 years old and had been out of work for an average of 1.8 years. The panel took place at Rutgers University, which had recently launched a \u201cNew Start Career Network\u201d focusing on older, long-term unemployed workers .\n\n\u201cFor them, it was hugely significant, the simple fact that the highest-ranking official in the country who deals with these issues took the time to talk to them about their experiences with long-term unemployment,\u201d Maria Heidkamp, director of the network, told the Guardian. \u201cIt was very meaningful to them.\u201d\n\nIn the nearly four months since they met Perez, one of the attendees got a one-year contract. Three others were able to find short-term work on a two- to three-month contract. \u201cWe are hoping that in couple of those cases it turns into something longer term,\u201d said Heidkamp.\n\nWhat\u2019s next\n\nWhile visiting long-term unemployed in New Jersey, Perez joked that with his history of working for a handful of employers in the public sector for longer periods of time, he \u201cwould have had trouble on the job hunt\u201d in a modern market where staying with one employer is not always viewed favorably.\n\nJokes aside, his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is impressive. After becoming the first Latino elected to the Montgomery County council and later serving as its president, Perez ran for attorney general of Maryland in 2006. However, his campaign came to a stop after one of his rivals sued him alleging that he had not practiced law for 10 years and therefore did not meet the requirements to serve. That same year, Martin O\u2019Malley was elected as the state\u2019s governor and later appointed Perez to serve as the state\u2019s labor secretary.\n\nIn October of 2009, Perez joined the US Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division as assistant general attorney. While there he had investigated the death of Trayvon Martin, who was killed by George Zimmerman in February 2012, abuse at police departments in cities such as Miami and Seattle and civil rights violations by anti-immigration sheriff Joe Arpaio. In the summer of 2013, he was tagged by Barack Obama to run the US Department of Labor.\n\nTo many of his supporters it comes as no surprise that since then, Perez\u2019s name has been floated for a number of other posts. When Eric Holder stepped down as US attorney general, Mother Jones ran a piece headlined: \u201cWhy picking Tom Perez for attorney general would be a smart move for Obama\u201d. Earlier this year when the supreme court justice Antonin Scalia died, Perez\u2019s name came up in the pool of potential replacements .\n\nThe past few months have also seen speculation that Perez might end up as Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate. Perez \u2013 who has at times joined Clinton on the campaign trail \u2013 insists he is focused on his day job.\n\n\u201cEvery engagement that I have had with him, he knows the number of days left in the president\u2019s term,\u201d said Henry. \u201cThe thing I admire in him is that even though speculation is happening, he remains laser-focused on trying to implement the fair pay and safe workplaces executive orders that we worked for six years to come to light. He is completely indefatigable on making sure that anything on his plate gets his full attention before he ends the term.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, while speaking to a room of journalists, Perez once again dodged a question about his possible vice-presidency. The comments came after he said mass deportation proposals floated by some Republicans \u201cwon\u2019t happen\u201d and added that he was confident the US government was going to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the next year.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t keep demonizing the largest growing population in America and think that that\u2019s a good strategy for growth,\u201d he said, pointing to the naturalization movement in immigrant communities. \u201cImmigration reformation is long overdue.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpoken like a vice-presidential nominee,\u201d quipped Bernie Kohn of Bloomberg News.\n\n\u201cI have not been approached,\u201d said Perez, dodging the question. \u201cI like my day job. Actually, I love my day job, what I am doing every day. I have 245 days until the weekend. I have a little sign on my desk, not because I want to count the days but because I want to make all the days count.\u201d\n\nguardian.co.uk \u00a9 Guardian News and Media 2016", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/perez-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "\u2018Tom Perez has guts\u2019: US labor secretary being eyed as Clinton\u2019s running mate"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd211a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe are the only industrialized nation on the planet that does not have some form of paid leave.\n\u201cIt was very meaningful to them.\u201dIn the nearly four months since they met Perez, one of the attendees got a one-year contract.\nActually, I love my day job, what I am doing every day.\nBig business has come out swinging against his changes to paid leave.\nThe past few months have also seen speculation that Perez might end up as Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate."}
