Root said the Republican establishment “should thank God because the Republican party is in vogue again.”

“We’ve got our mojo back,” he said. “He’s winning. I hate to quote Charlie Sheen, but in this case, Donald Trump is winning. You could tell. There’s no protesters at Rubio events. there’s no one trying to interrupt Cruz events. No one even knows Kasich’s name. Donald Trump is getting this incredible attack because he’s winning. He’s bothering the left, under their skin, and they know he’s the one that could beat Hillary Clinton.”

He added, “I think it’s very much like Ronald Reagan. I was the first commentator in the country who compared Trump to Reagan. I think the reaction is exactly the same, Clayton. I was there. I was at Columbia University, the center of the liberal universe, from 1980 to ’83 when Reagan was running in and then elected president. The response of the kids on campus and professors, exactly Trump today. They’re scared to death, We are winning, We’re taking back the agenda. We’re not punching bags anymore. We’re actually punching back. And that’s a good thing because I don’t want to be a punching bag. It’s been 7.5 years under Barack Obama where the Republican party’s been a punching bag under John Boehner, Mitch McConnell, and even under Paul Ryan. I’m proud that Donald Trump is hitting back.”
